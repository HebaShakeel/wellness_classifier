                    Hello Everyone. Long time no talk. I am struggling with anxiety again. I
currently work 3 days a week. The pay is good but I have this feeling in
me that I should be working 5 days a week as I feel bad for my husband.
I know in my heart that I can't handle 5 days a week but my mind is not
helping. My middle daughter left her stable job as she wasn't happy and
now cannot find another job. She has less then $100 left in her bank
account and she is struggling mentally as well and I don't know how to
help her. My youngest daughter who has a medical condition is not well
at the moment and can't seem to get better so things are pretty tense at
the moment. I had a bit of a light bulb moment the other night in
regards to my mother living with us (which I am not happy with). I
realised that I don't understand why I am obligated to take her in and
care for her when she didn't look after me when I was younger.I just
honestly feel like everyone would be better if I wasn't here with my
issues but I don't know how to fix them. Sorry, I know it might not make
sense I just needed to get it off my chest.

                    A consultant at work was given some chocolates from a patient and left
the clinic without taking them. One of the other doctors working with
the consultant said I should take them home because I don't think she
will want them. A week later the the consultant had been asking around
who took them. The doctor who said I should take them home said she left
them with the nurses and the nurses would keep them safe. A few people
asked me if I knew what happened including the consultant which I lied
and said I didn't know. Ever since, I have had bad anxiety thinking I am
going to get in trouble. I have asked a few friends and family what I
should do and if I should replace them. They have all said to not worry
about it but I can't stop worrying. I might need more or better advice
please.

                    Hi, this is my frist time doing this, im not quite sure what to do but,
yeah. Anyway, I had just finished semester 2 and was on a 3 week break,
the first thing i get told when i get home is that my granddads cancer
is back and they won't be a ble to stop it this time and he has 6 months
at most left, so that was a great way to start the holidays, so my mum
went up to Queensland to be with him before his operation to remove
parts of the cancer out of his stomach so they can put a tube in but its
a very dangerous surgery but if they don't put a tube in he can't eat(
he can eat but the amount of cancer in his stomach makes him full really
quickly). So anyway my mums been up in Queensland since about 2 weeks
ago the surgerys been pushed back many times due to complications. So
now we are just waiting. These holidays I've also been to a funeral of
my best friends dad and my great Nan. I havent seen my Mum for like 2
weeks and i know she'll be home soon and shes up there for a reason, so
ive sorta just been stuck in like a blackhole for a bit, And i know i
just dumped alot on everyone and im sorry but i havent told any of my
friends bc i don't wanna seem like im trying to draw attention to myself
or anything and i can't talk to my dad bc my brothers going through alot
at the moment with major anxiety and i know its hard for him to, but
yeah. Im happy to chat to anyone, about anything, i was just hoping to
talk to someone about what i feel and not feel like a burden on anyone,
but ill talk about anything with anyone. Im a Huge AFL fan and love
being creative and drawing

                    I have this constant feeling of overwhelm and anxiety. Currently
recovering from influenza A. I just want to feel normal again

                    For years, I have been feeling empty when I am by myself. I hate this
feeling. I often try to have people around me by spending money on them,
taking them out for dinners. While I am generous, I don’t want to use
this behavior to cover my empty feeling. I want to feel cheered up
without needing to be around people. I want to feel motivated to do
things for myself. I want to live for myself, not just because I have to
live and do my best for my young daughter. I am unable to leave the
house if I don’t have someone with me. For instance, I force myself to
go to the grocery store for groceries. I see psychologist every
fortnight but I go back to the empty feeling as I walk out the
counseling sessions. How can I stop this madness?

                    I have been doing so well for a couple of years on my old medication and
now suddenly I am so much worse again. I feel jittery about little
things, my mind is going crazy from just thinking if I have to do some
housework and my mind gets overwhelmed that I get physically sick. This
morning I had to call in sick again and usually I was able to push
myself to just one sick day a month! I feel physically week and run
down, just no energy to do anything but lie in bed, but have to push
myself today to go and get my new medication... I am so angry at myself,
nobody will put up with this for long and I am trying to do the right
thing but feel more and more frustrated with things around me. If I
leave out something in housework or to do, it all piles up and making me
more and more overwhelmed

                    Hi and best wishes to everyone..Im starting to get very scared again and
having panic like attacks. I just feel so alone at times and this might
sound strange but i feel like a kid who just wants to give his mum a
hug. But im 58 i lost my mum at 18 and Dad in 2000 and have no real
family support. Im currently not working and dont feel i have the energy
to start again. I just do some volunteer work one day a week at a
hospital. Ive never really progressed in life i just seem to have filled
in time . I feel like i have had enough a times. Best wishes Brett

                    Hi there,I'd appreciate your thoughts or suggestions on what to do about
knowing people are talking about you behind your back or if you suspect
they are talking about you behind your back. There have been times in
the past when this has been overwhelming and confusing because, what are
you supposed to do in this situation? It can bring on a sense of dead
and insecurity and I'm not sure how to respond to it. I'm the sort of
person who avoids conflict but I've also noticed this is very common in
today's society where everyone is comparing themselves and using social
media, which has increased the amount of gossip, misinformation, and
dare I say it 'bitchy' behaviour in general. Sometimes I have overheard
people talking about me in a way that they have clearly misunderstood my
intentions or who I am as a person, but I also want to keep the peace
and not confront anyone. Anyway, I'd appreciate your thoughts!

                    So I have had experience with severe anxiety in the past, to the point
where I can't eat, can't sleep and literally can't sit still. I have
gotten through it in the past after basically just waiting it out and I
thought I had overcome it. Something has triggered my anxiety again
yesterday and I am struggling to pinpoint why. I feel like I can come up
with lots of 'this could be why' explanations or maybe it's all of the
things. My main symptoms is a sick churning feeling in my stomach.
Sometimes it is constant but at the moment it is on and off. It stops
when I am distracted by something but as soon as I let my mind think
again it comes strait back. I can barely eat, I am force feeding myself
just so my stomach doesn't hurt from lack of food but I have zero
appetite. I wake up every day feeling nauseated for as long as I can
remember, I honestly feel awful on waking but I'm not sure why. I am so
tired and groggy from constant worry but I can hardly sleep. When I do
fall asleep I wake up in the early hours worrying and heart pounding. I
have a beautiful partner but they don't know how to help and it is not
up to them anyway. I think I am stressing about my work but my work
isn't THAT stressful so I think it's my personality mostly. I have tried
all the techniques but I just feel like it's a case of riding it out
again which sucks because I don't know how long it will be pure torture
for. I hate myself for being this way, my life is not otherwise
uncomfortable. I can't predict when this will happen which makes it more
devastating when it does. Why can't I just get peace? It's my brain
that's broken so why can't my brain fix it?

                    Work place gossip is getting on top of me right now. I'm currently
struggling with a lot of things in my personal life and I've still been
doing my job but I haven't been as motivated and I have had to take days
off. I know taking time off can cause coworkers to respect me less but i
can't handle work when I'm having panic attacks or need to sort out
appointments and my living situation. There are lots of office politics
and I'm a supervisor at work and I've had another co-worker tell me
things bosses have said about me that they're trying to ""catch me out""
and they dont want to critise me incase it effects my mental health. I
also worry this co-worker is repeating things I say to the boss as well
and she has bragged about being the bosses ""spy"" and I thought I was
friends with this person. The bosses talking about me like that has lead
to other issues with undermining and talking about other staff members
and calling them useless. I tried to talk to my boss about it but I
don't think they handled it very well and said my coworker is ""getting
too big for their boots"" and immediately brought them into the office
after, i wasnt trying to start drama i wanted to know how to handle the
situation and stop any bullying of other team members. She tried to
blame shift onto another manager though and she either is in the dark or
pretends to be. Every aspect of my life is crumbling right now and my
mental health is suffering. I don't want to quit my job if it's just
paranoia. I try my best to focus on my work and avoid drama but it got
the best of me and my confidence is gone. I want to talk to the boss
about taking time off but I know that's going to cause more gossip. I
have wanted a new job for a long time but if I leave I know they will be
short staffed and pissed off. I know I'm not the type of co-worker
people might want to be around because of my anxiety. They have done a
lot for me but I don't feel like I can keep working like this and I
don't want to be that person that is just complaining and worrying all
the time. This is my first good job and I've been there 3 years with no
issues like this until recently. I really struggle with social
interactions and the boss said they trust me and I'm important to them
but then they're possibly talking about me behind my back. Rather than
talking to me they'll probably cut my shifts for a while. Has anyone
else's stress and anxiety caused them to quit a job? Is this normal
workplace gossip or potentionally toxic?

                    And got diagnosed with severe anxiety. I didn't know it was this bad.
Like, obviously I knew it was bad....but severe?? I should add that I've
has anxiety for a while just as a general handbrake on my life. But now
it's...yea. It was, I suppose the first time I was truly honest with
what was happening. The doctor I had was great too, it wasn't a tick and
flick exercise for her - I felt truly listened too. How the hell did I
get here? I look after myself, sleep, eat, volunteer, work etc I don't
know what more I can do. I can't change my past.

                    Hi. My daughter suffers from bad night sweats as a symptom of taking
Anxiety medication. They appear to be hormonal as they occur when she is
either ovulating or menstruating. I'm wondering if anyone else suffers
from this symptom and if so, do they have any tips or remedies to ease
these? It seems unreal for her to have to deal with this, for a week at
a time, every month - broken sleeps and having to change her bedding
during the night, every night, during those weeks. TIA

                    Hi guys, it’s already a month, the company dismissed me. It is unfair
because they can't reprimand one of our co-workers. My co-worker is my
senior, I thought he would help me to learn but he is bothering me even
more in my work. I was being yelled at, all my output was wrong as if I
was stupid, and I also questioned myself. I can't sleep well, I can't
eat, I don't feel hungry, I just lie down all day, I try to get up but
my body doesn't want to. I have lost weight, I don't even know how to
start.I have also been told by people about what is happening to me,
that I thought they would understand me, in fact they judged me more.My
heart hurts so much, I can't stop crying, I feel useless. how do I start
getting up again?

                    Hey GuysI am a single parent who is struggling to get my son interested
in his school work. In a recent parent teacher interview, his teachers
told me he is a polite child but is not interested in his studies. The
teachers told me that he shows no interest in his subjects. Not sure
what to do. I spoke to him and he promises that he will do better. I
find it hard as he has been promising me this for last few years. I
don’t know how to get him interested in his subject.

                    Hello all, I previously posted here a couple of months ago about my
current situation. Since then, I have had a few days where I have been
good and have been able to manage my anxiety, but as of late, I have
been struggling to get out of the dreaded dark hole of ""doctor google or
doctor youtube"" and I have self-diagnosed myself with something drastic
because my doctor ""missed something"". There have been times when I would
journal but have found it difficult to make journalling a routine to
write something good about that day - if that makes sense. I kinda am
the person that I would be a listening ear for someone during their hard
times, but when it comes to myself, i tend to flick it under the rug and
go about my life. I have hit a brick wall.

                    Hi all, I am a young person who has had anxiety for over 10 years. I
know the techniques to use - breathing, meditation, distraction etc, but
have never put in the time to practice these things so when things do
hit the fan (like right now!) I am a jittery mess. I need advice on
getting myself motivated to get back on track to do normal things like
work and see friends. I don't want to live my live being controlled by
my own silly thoughts anymore.

"
                    At times I tell my anxiety to stop, go away, leave me alone. I thought
it might be good to put it into a post. Feel free to write your own
letter. Dear anxiety,I've has enough of you & you need to leave. I am a
strong, confident, positive person & you come in & try to take it away.
You always pounce when I'm a little vulnerable & you just keep pick,
pick, picking at me until my thoughts go round in circles. Well, you
won't win. I know your game & I'm not playing.Go back into your little
hole, you won't get the better of me Cmf

                    Hi, I am 14 in year 9 and live in Australia. I am a high achiever, I get
good grades, am house captain, and get some academic awards. so most
people think I am fine but I am not. I have panic attacks every day and
always feel like my mind is a black hole of empty nothingness that will
never be good enough. I am pretty good at faking a smile and only crying
when I am alone but sometimes I just can't and people always judge me.
School takes up so much of my energy that I am usually stuck in bed for
the rest of the day as soon as I get home because it is too hard to get
up. whenever I tell someone they are always surprised and I am scared
they don't believe me. I am on medication and go to therapy but if
anyone has any suggestions on what I can do to not feel like this I
would appreciate it. thank you.

                    Hi,I'm extremely reluctant making this post for all the obvious reasons,
but reading some of the other posts here has given me the courage to do
so. I'm 48, have had s.a.d for at least 35-40 of those years and have
never sought advice on the subject. I've never been diagnosed
officially, and have only started to fully accepted the fact recently,
due to a problem I'm facing. A problem I had managed to avoid up until
this point in my life. I have done some reading online over the years to
get an understanding of my condition and believed I understood it well
enough. I spent my teenage years and most of my 20s completely ignorant
and fighting off depression. After realizing s.a.d was the main cause I
was able to move past the depression, or so I thought. Gradually I chose
to live a very isolated life and not rely on other people for my own
happiness. I have never been able to hold a job for a long period of
time, or had many friends that ever lasted particularly long. I have
never found any true happiness, but in recent years I had found peace.
There has always been a personal reason that has allowed me to get out
of bed each and everyday. The peace I had found always had a clock on it
and I knew it. It gave me both the confidence and motivation to step
well out of my comfort zone and that seems to have backfired on me. The
combination, of my s.a.d and lacking social skills which have
deteriorated over time, has left me extremely confused and disappointed
to say the least. I am capable of, participate in, and enjoy short
social interactions. However I have never been capable of speaking to a
gp, or anyone really, face to face about mental health. Any advice on
moving forward after a huge reality check and setback would be
appreciated. I'll say thank you, now, for reading...and any replies, as
I'm unsure if I will respond to any. Sorry hope you understand.

                    Hi everyone, I'm reaching out as something that has been coming up for
me a lot lately has been social anxiety, mostly stemming from my deep
issues with shame. I am aware my unhelpful thinking style makes me jump
to conclusions and assume people think I'm stupid, pathetic, weak &
useless. And I know it isn't true, but in the moments that I talk to
people, I find I lack the confidence to think differently. I don't have
a diagnosis of ASD or ADHD, and I actually have a good amount of friends
which one might not think of someone with social anxiety. But I can only
be myself around 'my people' or only certain kinds of people. I'm an
introvert that can sometimes pass as an extrovert but I'm always
extremely drained after social events/work. Here are some examples for
context:-At work, I struggle to have conversation & make eye contact
with my boss. I am afraid they will discover I am not cut out for the
job. I'm also hyper aware that they are an 'extremely business-minded'
person, and I sometimes feel my interactions with them are not
genuine...People that are in authoritative positions, especially older
men, I find extremely difficult to talk to. I sense that they write me
off as 'a silly' girl.-I attend a writing group once a month. During the
group, I am so uncomfortable in sharing my opinion about someone's work
(because it involves speaking in front of people I don't really know)
that I can't concentrate on the writing they are reading aloud. Everyone
is able to give solid feedback, but I struggle to remember what they
even said as I was panicking about speaking!-Lastly, when people ask how
I'm doing, how my writing is going yatta yatta, I start rambling.
Because I don't feel like I've accomplished much with my life I always
feel embarrassed talking about the fact I work part time and I struggle
to write because I'm feeling depressed...but I can't say these things!
I'm probably rambling right now! Sorry for the long post...I'm after
advice, materials and strategies to combat these issues. Does anyone
else ever get moments when you disassociate in a conversation, or think
about trying to make eye contact when someone is speaking that you
really struggle to stay in the moment?

to navigate your anxiety with an ex while coparenting.
                "
"
                    I am a 63 years old spinster who has a few mental health problems to say
the least. They include anxiety, OCD, paranoia, depression, agoraphobia,
social phobia, hyper-sensitivity and suicidal thoughts to begin with. I
have been isolated for decades with no friends or contact with my
family, which is my fault as I have isolated myself and I don't want to
be a burden. They once told me I'm very depressing and negative which is
probably true. I find it very difficult to connect with people because I
mistrust them and over think everything they say to the point I am left
exhausted. I'm on medication and it helps with my OCD but nothing else,
and like many others, cannot afford counselling. I retired in 2019 as I
had a breakdown at work due to bullying. I have no self confidence, and
see myself as repulsive. I only leave my house once a week to food shop
and I cover my face with a large hat and wear sunglasses and have
headphones on to try and hide. I wish I knew how to enjoy life on my own
but have been made to feel such shame and guilt. I'm also being bullied
by my neighbours who play cruel jokes on me so I often ring Lifeline
when it gets really bad. In Feburary they set off fireworks right
outside my house which terrified me as the sparks landed in my front
yard and roof also they like to tip my wheelie bins over. I've never
bothered any of them but they are a small gang of four roughly the same
age as me but unlike me they are very social. I can't remember the last
time I felt safe and happy. Sorry but I'm feeling very overwhelmed with
life.

                    Hello, I am new to these forums so I hope you might be able to help me.
I am constantly in Fight or Flight mode. My son is going through a very
nasty custody battle with his partner who is a Narcissist, though I
think she is bordering on Psycotic. There are constant lies told by her,
false accusations to Police and instances trying to 'frame' our family
to stop us having any access to our grandchildren as well as keeping our
son away from his children. I am always on standby waiting for the next
lie told, the next time my son has to make a statement to Police
regarding her false accusations , it never ends. I can find no one to
help us. I feel my anxiety is out of control, headaches, panic, bitten
fingernails and unable to relax due to fear of this person. I'm hoping
someone might be able to help control my anxiety, so I am better to cope
with the next allegation. Thankyou.

                    Hi everyone! Little backstory to me - I’m in my 30s, have a fair bit of
childhood trauma (was born with a physical condition and went through a
lot of misunderstanding, discrimination and bullying, though my family
is awesome). In my twenties I lived in a religious community where I
experienced emotional and psychological abuse. I left that community two
years ago, very unwell with anorexia (which I now know was triggered by
trauma). Since then I’ve had a lot of PTSD issues. Flashbacks,
irritability, nightmares, heightened anxiety, self-blame for what
happened, and social/situational avoidance. I’ve not really been treated
consistently for the PTSD. I met my fiancé last year and we are getting
married in October. My fiancé is wonderful, honestly the kindest person
I’ve ever met, and he has been so accepting of me and my issues. I
really want to marry him and I know we are meant to be together. But I
just can’t cope. I can’t cope with the fact that someone wants to be
with me because all I hear are the messages from my trauma. I don’t feel
good enough, I don’t feel deserving of goodness, and being loved and
wanted just feels like too much. I’ve been having a lot more crying
episodes (picture full-on sobbing) and triggers lately and I wonder if
it’s connected to that. Talking about this makes me feel a bit dumb,
because who would be upset or anxious about being loved??? My natural
instinct tells me it’s much better for me to be alone, because then I
can’t be hurt and I can’t hurt other people, but I can’t really do that
in this instance. I think the crux of it is that I feel so incredibly
undeserving of all the good things I have, I just can’t cope with
goodness, and it just feels like way too much. I’ve talked to my fiancé
about this a little and he always tells me I am deserving and he loves
me, but I don’t want to overwhelm him with this. I’ve felt very happy
planning our wedding day, but now thinking about it makes me feel a
little apprehensive - not that I don’t want to marry him, just that
having such a day celebrating us feels like way too much for my brain,
because I don’t deserve it.

                    Hello, Im sure other people suffer from health anxiety and I do too, and
it’s really bad. Considering my age, I’m very young but even the tiniest
throb, headache, cough worries me and it’s draining me faster and worse
than my own health can. It’s extremely scary and I can’t seem to find
people with similar constant Symptoms that come with their anxiety, no
matter how much research I do so I’m convinced it’s something bad. Which
makes me feel unmotivated to do absolutely anything, I leave things to
the very last minute and I can’t even keep up with basic hygiene because
I feel like there’s no use, also makes me feel awful. When I do get
random boosts of motivation (rarely) or feel like I can calm down, I
immediately can’t anymore, I tense up or get even slightly anxious that
something bad will happen after that and that’s the only reason I was
allowed to be “normal” for a bit, so I leave that and force myself to
feel more down and empty, But in general everything feels meaningless at
the same time. If anyone feels similar I’d love for a reply!

                    Does anyone else get dizzy with anxiety 
                "
"
                    I have been doing support work for a couple of months and really love
it. I’ve got three clients at the moment, which is great as it balances
well with my part-time job. I came into this work after living in a very
structured religious community for almost ten years. Like everything
being accounted for, often being supervised and criticised on
performance, having very little independence. I left that life very
unwell with anorexia and now live with that (I’m recovering) and PTSD,
which has been dealt with on-and-off by professionals. One client is
seriously unwell and has support workers round the clock. They live with
family and they have set up a really clear system and routine for
support workers. Support workers sign in, there’s a handbook for them,
they need to record all the tasks they do, etc. My client is so lovely,
but they’re also very assertive and direct. They are great qualities,
and this might sound weird - I find myself a bit scared of them at
times. Dealing with very direct people reminds me of my past, because
directness has often turned into personal attacks, and because I was
always expected to be perfect, all the time. I also find the routine and
environment gives me a lot of flashbacks - being supervised as I do
housework, being directed on chores to do, etc. Sometimes I actually
dread going there. And it’s nothing they are doing wrong, these are all
my issues, and that’s what makes me feel bad. I have thought about
ending with this client, but I feel terrible doing so. I feel like I’ll
let them and their family down because they need support. Part of me
thinks they will understand if I explain it. I really love working with
them generally, it’s just these things which have hit me unexpectedly. I
guess I’m looking for a bit of perspective here….? Thanks!

                    Hey everyone, I posted for the first time a few months ago and kinda
wanted to track my progress. I’ve recently gone through a lot of new
experiences with starting uni and a new job which have been quite
challenging. New things bring up a lot of anxiety and it is often super
hard to deal with. I honestly I didn’t think I would be able to do it as
I often cut experiences short due to overthinking and panic. However
I’ve taken the time to reflect on the past few months and realised that
I am indeed still surviving. Though it’s not easy and I feel like shit
most of the time - like I’m too stupid for uni or I’m doing my job
completely wrong, which led to a bit of a breakdown in front of my boss.
And that no one likes me and all my friends want to leave me; I’ve
realised that I’m actually sticking with it all. This is the longest
I’ve held a job for (the last one I quit cause the thought of doing
things wrong was too overwhelming), I’ve been getting good grades at
school and I’ve even managed to make new friends at uni whilst still
being in contact with old ones. it’s so hard to recognise my
achievements when it seems like other people do all those things so
easily and I’m drowning. But I’m proud of the fact that I now am able to
take a step back and recognise that I am doing the things that I thought
would ruin me everyday. Maybe this means I’m getting better at dealing
with my troubling thoughts? I just wish I knew how to deal with things
better in the moment. Hope everyone is well, just wanted to vocalise my
thoughts.

                    Hello everyone, I have had anxiety for the past 15 years and I managed
it as best as I could. I was diagnosed with GAD and PTSD and I am only
38 years old, but the GAD has been around forever. My main problem is
physical symptoms of anxiety. I have acid reflux, sometimes I vomit
acid. Blood work came back with fatty liver, high cholesterol. I've also
had high heart rate and high BP. I 'self medicated' with non-alcoholic
beer (around 100 beers a month), high fatty foods and lots of sugar. I
have this embedded fear of dying young, but in the same time I do next
to nothing to improve my wellbeing. What concerns me the most is that
from time to time (recently they have begun to appear more frequently),
I get these vomiting and coughing spouts. I usually vomit acid, which
may be from the stomach. Today I vomited twice. I am afraid of
revisiting the doctor and I don't quite know where it is coming from.
Can someone please share their diet and acid reflux+anxiety stories? Any
useful information will help so that I may start doing something to
improve myself. My only vices are my bad diet, non-alcoholic beer and I
play video games a lot. As I type now I have this fear that an anxiety
attack might resurface and I will be awake at night or have interrupted
sleep. Thank you!Jordan

                    Hey, I know I'm not alone in struggling to accept and move on from a
breakup. It's a tale as old as time and something most everyone has
grappled with at some point in their life. It's been three months since
my partner and I broke up. We were together for five years- I believed I
would marry this man. I imagined our future life-he and I often talked
about it. Having children, creating a life and a home. And three months
ago that came crashing down. I thought with even this small passing of
time (3 months) I would be feeling better- if only marginally. I feel
worse. I am able to function in my life, my job, my self care routine.
But the pain of missing him, all the hopes, dreams and plans we made
play out in my head. I know it's a grieving process, he wasn't just my
partner, he was my best friend, my family, someone who was always in my
corner. I really loved him. Still do. I am just so exhausted from this
pain of not having him in my life. Of missing him. Everywhere I go, I'm
reminded of five years' worth of memories- all with him. How do you
learn to let go of someone you thought would be in your life forever?
How do you let go of someone that you love so deeply?

                    Hello. My mind will constantly pop up with negative social memories from
my past, particularly from late primary school and high school. I've
been having this issue since around 2018. I'm in my early 20s and
haven't socialised much since, hence not many opportunities for new
negative memories (but some exist). Context:I've had persistently
negative social experiences for a long period (or so I perceive). I was
a very shy kid. From around the age of 10 I felt I was being mistreated
socially, my mental health became overall negative, and has been there
ever since. The core beliefs I have developed are something along the
lines of ""I'm unlikeable"" and that ""I don't know how to socialise"". I
remember having severe levels of social anxiety in school (sore stomach
before school, constantly keeping hands in pockets, being unable to
speak properly, etc). Whilst I'm socially anxious now, it's no where
near to the same extent. Although my ""social performance"" still feels
inadequate. Types of Memories:- Times people mistreated me (bullied,
excluded, mocked, etc.)- Instances where I perceive that people disliked
me (telling me to shut up, giving me that ""why are you here"" sort of
look, etc).- Embarrassing things I did (usually the things need to imply
that I'm unlikeable or socially incompetent, otherwise they aren't a big
deal)- Times I was bad to others (I didn't do this super often, but I
feel severe guilt about it) My question:So, what can I do to
assuage/stop the constant reliving of negative memories I experience?
Even if I assume I am unlikeable etc., I just don't see how constantly
reliving the memories serves me. It's torturing me for no benefit, every
day. It feels like something unresolved that my mind has been in severe
strife about for a very long time. I understand people with PTSD will
relive their memories, but that's much more understandable to me, it
would be very difficult to process those sorts of experiences. It's
driving me insane. Is this something I just have to accept until I maybe
solve my social isolation/struggles in the future? Is this some rare
issue only I face? What do I do?

work in the nursing homes or do ad hoc duties which I got no reply back
from my boss , the difficulty of staying is how to justify going to work
for 3 hours , 1.5 hours ect each day and travelling 45 minutes to do
said job of 3 hours or 1.6 hours, the difficulty of leaving while trying
to get another job which I’ve been looking for months and no success. I
kinda fell I’m stuck and my savings are running out I’ve got drs, a few
specialists cause I have health problems and I can’t afford to go see
them cause my wage or part of it goes on rent and food even now I’ll
have to extend my gas bill cause I can’t afford to pay it this week
because I only have a few 100 dollars left and i have to see a
specialist this week as well which is 160$ down the drain , life is
really hard right now with the lack of work hours and I can’t sleep much
for thinking how will i manage to keep enough in the bank til pay day
there’s no relief and no easy answer im on centerlink but even that with
the little pay i get off work is constantly not enough to make ends

Then after for days I play the conversations over and over, feel
exposed, vulnerable and embarrassed and very anxious. Its consuming. Is
this something others experience? How do you cope? I used to be so
social and carefree, but even old memoroes that used to be joyful cause
me distress.

                    I've been on the receiving end of being bullied by some of my
co-workers, one in particular for a while now. I'm not the only person
being bullied by her, nearly everyone has been bullied by her. It
started when I returned back to work in 2021 after recovering from a
back injury, she was a new hire and constantly on my back about every
little thing. Eventually I told her that I know exactly how to do my
job, if the manager has an issue with my work she can bring it to my
attention herself and that she should focus on her work instead of mine
as I was feeling harassed.Since then she started reporting ME for
bullying HER. For example, I was on the phone with a customer and at the
same time she was speaking to me and started to raise her voice to tell
me inaccurate information about what she thought I was discussing with
the customer. With the call on hold I told her I was busy with a
customer, I've got it thanks, but if she wanted to speak with me, she
shouldn't be yelling misinformation at me while I'm with a customer. She
immediately went into our managers office, I go back to my phone call,
customer heard the yelling asked if everything was okay. When the call
was completed I can hear her crying to the manager and when she comes
out of the office and passes me she gives me the stink eye before
leaving. My manager comes out a few seconds later and she told me that
she saw everything that happened through the mirrored window between her
office and the reception office where I work and that the co-worker had
reported me for my tone and disrespect for ""ignoring her"" while I was on
the phone. Similar instances kept happening to the point where I
isolated myself from her at work because she would turn any interaction
we had into me bullying her. Making me anxious about any interaction I
had with her, costing my job. Other staff members came forward to
support my version of events a lot. But everything still takes its toll.
I remember reporting her for non-compliance with our employee code of
conduct for promoting her private business to customer that would come
to our workplace after I had multiple phone calls and people walking in
to reception asking for her to discuss her business. The senior manager
at the time said I was being PETTY and to only report serious matters.
Now, I feel like I can't report her for her bullying towards me. Even
though my direct manager sees whats happening, the Senior manager (who
now works in the HR department) favors my bully.

                    Hello,I have always been known as a shy person whereas my older sister
has always been very outgoing so I felt like I grew up in her shadow. As
a child I found it hard to see my positive qualities and never saw
introversion as a strength because everyone around me criticised me for
being shy and I grew up hating my shyness. Maybe because of my shyness
or other reasons I always felt self conscious and rarely felt
comfortable around people who weren’t my immediate family. When I was 7
years old my family moved country and I rarely saw my loving
grandparents again and felt like my family consisted of only my parents
and older sister. During my teenage years I struggled with disordered
eating and despite doing well at school felt very self conscious in
class and found everyday things overwhelming and felt like I was out of
step with the other students. I found it difficult to envisage what I
would do as a career but wasn’t too concerned because I still had a lot
of time to decide. I decided I loved art and music and tried to force
myself to do drama so that I wouldn’t be so shy. When I was 17 my
parents decided to divorce. It came as a shock but sort of validated why
I had felt unhappy as a teenager. Beforehand I had started to feel
distant from my parents and they had been going through other things
they had reason to be stressed about. My Mum had suggested I talk to
someone about my disordered eating but I felt so much shame and distrust
in people that I hated the idea. I also hid how I was feeling and was
already known to be shy so not many people seemed to notice how unhappy
I was. Now I’m in my late 20s and I’ve finally seen a psychologist for
about two years. I recently moved to a new city and although I’ve
completed a bachelor degree in science I’m finding it hard to get a job.
A lot of the same feelings have come up that I used to feel, they’ve
never really gone away. I do understand myself a lot better than I ever
have in the past and now see there are strengths that introverts have.
But I’m still struggling to enjoy my life, like myself and make friends…
and being unemployed sucks. Sometimes it just feels like I can’t catch a
break. I’ve been through so much and would love to have a healthy
romantic relationship, strong friendships, a meaningful job, and enjoy
my life but sometimes it feels like I’ll never get there. I am starting
to blame myself for not choosing a definitive career path sooner. I
committed to university only to come out the other side with more doubts
and uncertainties about my career than I had when I started. I feel like
I’ve missed out on so many opportunities because I am an introvert. I’ve
worked so hard at my education and the most recent jobs I have had and
still feel like I’m never doing the things I truly want to be doing.
I’ve also struggled to accept my sexuality and have disliked my body
ever since I returned to a healthier weight. So there’s been a lot for
me to deal with and maybe I’ve been self sabotaging myself all along, I
don’t know for sure. Today I just felt really sad and unsure of what to
focus on in my life because I have a lot of interests but something
always seems to go sour at some point and I stop doing something I once
loved

                    Do you have Dissociative Identity Disorder? Many people live with D.I.D
all over the world. DISSOCIATIVE IDENTITY DISORDER Dissociative identity
disorder is a survival mechanism of the brain. It is more of an ability
that keeps a child alive throughout continual and ongoing abuse in early
childhood. Much like surviving a traumatic car accident, trauma to the
head can result in the brain shutting down in order to cope with the
enormity of the damage afflicted. The brain is protecting itself. With
D.I.D this then results in shutting down of self also. Memory becomes
separated and these separated memories may remain dormant until they are
accessible again in later years when memory recall of the abuse events
become active(flashbacks). The memories are also affected at the time by
the child's perception of self and the world around them. Memories
combined with self perception contribute toward the development of
individual parts of self. These separations also called fracturing
create new and separate sense of self resulting in separated parts of
identity. The separated parts of self then become individual and can
function separately from one another with individual characteristics and
personalities. Not all separated parts have a personality they may only
carry characteristic traits. The original term Multiple Personality was
changed to Dissociative Identity because this is more than just
personality changes. The new name now used, DISSOCIATIVE IDENTITY
DISORDER, is because of the extreme level of dissociation needed to
survive the abuse and the reason the separations are able to happen.”

                    Hi all, I have been out for a long time from my profession and just
recently decided to go back. I am having lots of anxiety and worries
since I started my training. I saw how everyone is fast and able to do
their task on time. I got so scared that I might not be able to cope
with fast pace of the job. I am thinking that I won’t be able to catch
up and learn how it works. I am worried that I will make a huge mistake.
Next week they will give me task that is making me more anxious.
Thinking that I should give up this profession.

                    Struggling with no supportI’m a young mum to a toddler, trying to
navigate relationships, working full time (I have 2 jobs) and nursing
full time.Safe to say that’s a lot for anyone to deal with day to day.on
top of this, I have been struggling every single day of my life since
childhood. I’ve been experiencing debilitating anxiety since I was 6
(granted I always thought I felt guilty for no reason but didn’t
understand the feeling till I got older)I used to tic a lot as a kid and
many other issues like that which were never taken seriously or followed
up on by my parents. Instead they would shame me about itand this has
snowballed to the point where I’ve experienced multiple traumatic events
and I’m struggling to process it all on top of my day to day life, this
anxiety and everything else happening in my brainI notice One normal
issue anyone else experiences really takes a toll on me and I
internalise all my emotion with itI struggle with reaching out for help
I always have. But I have made steps to outwardly tell my partner or
family or friends but they seem to picture me as someone who “handles
everything” and any advice they give just seems so superficial and
vague. Stuff like “oh but you’ll work it out like you always do
:)”Helplines and counselling services are just as uselessI seeked out
professional help but sadly I’m not in the financial position to pay
$300 per session a weekI don’t know what I’m supposed to do. It seems
wherever I seek help in the places your supposed to, they don’t work and
when I try talk to my ‘support’ I feel like I’m not being believed or
taken seriouslyI don’t know what to do but I know I can’t keep living
with this burden for the rest of my life. I’m so overwhelmed most days I
constantly think of ways I can try to run away or escape everything…
this isn’t healthyWhat should I do?

                    Hey, so I have been bullied in the past when I was in highschool, at
work and even at home by my younger sister, who is four years younger
than me. I get stuck in a position where it feels like I can't think of
any comebacks. It's like I freeze on the spot and anything I do try to
say gets dismissed or they have the upper hand. They have the
satisfaction of winning the argument and get away with their negative
actions. And I feel like such a a loser. It feels like no matter what I
say to anyone, I would just get ignored or overlooked. Because what I
have to say doesn't matter. Am I weak for never thinking of a comeback
or something that would stop bullies in their tracks? And it feels like
my Mum sides with my sister because I'm older and I'm usually the mature
and reasonable one in the family. I always try to be kind to others so
does that make me a easy target. A punching bag people can throttle so
they can feel good about themselves. I know most people are going
through a hard time like my sister but I don't think it's fair to take
it out on me. But if I try to fight back, it suddenly feels like I am
the one in the wrong because I'm told I need to be more considerate of
those struggle even though they're taking it out on me. It's not fair.
It's like I am in a catch 22. No matter what I do, it feels like things
will always be unfair. Am I weak for not even thinking of a solid
comeback?

                    Hi, I'm new here but I'm not new to anxiety. When I was in high school I
developed this fear of assignments and public speaking, at one point I
went to the doctors and he diagnosed me with social anxiety, he
prescribed me medication but I refused to take it. I didn't want to
fight this with drugs, I just wanted to be able to over come it. Myself.
And I did, well the public speaking part. One day in high school I had
to do a long speech and ever since then I slowly got over my fear of
speaking in public. (Sounds simple, but it wasn't!) Don't get me wrong I
still get nervous but I've learnt to push my self into situations where
I have to do presentations and speak in class discussions. But the
anxiety when doing assignments has never really gone away. I
procrastinate to the point where I either rush the assignment or I leave
it completely for the next day (past the due date). I am in my final
year at university and I am still absolutely terrified of doing my
assignments, and I think its gotten worse because I have gotten more
busy, with uni, on top of work, family stuff and searching for a job. Is
this what I am going to be like when I start a job and have to complete
tasks on a deadline? I don't understand this irrational fear and it
frustrates me because I KNOW I can do it, its not like I don't have good
grades. I think its the fact that I'm being judged that ultimately
scares me. That people will be looking at my work and being like thats
just not good enough or you haven't done it right. I think thats why I
procrastinate, because If I leave it to the last minute then I don't
have that time to sit and worry about it and all I care about is getting
it done and submitting it. But I do care, I care about what marks I get
and I end up hating myself for not being able to start it earlier or
finishing it on time and thinking I could have done better if I started
earlier. In the end I'm writing this because I need advice, how do I
finally get over it? I have literally started smiling in the mirror
every time I need to start/ continue an assignment because apparently
you can trick yourself into thinking your not scared. Is it working? not
yet. But hopefully soon. Otherwise if anyone has any suggestions on how
I can overcome this anxiety that would be great, because I am sick and
tired of repeating this cycle. I just don't want to feel this way
anymore. Thanks in advance to anyone who replies to this - BeBrave

                    I’ve called in sick to work the last two days. I’ve had a sore throat
but also just so tired and burnt out. I’ve realised I’ve taken one sick
day per month since I started the job, is this bad? But if I’m burnt out
there’s obviously a pattern here meaning I’m not coping. Everyone at
work has been fine with me not coming in but my mum has made me feel
guilty. She has subtly suggested that maybe I’m not that sick/being
lazy. She doesn’t understand that I’m so tired just from going to work.
I’m on the hunt for a new job that will be better conditions and less
stressful hopefully, but in the meantime I’m dealing with a job where I
have to at least stay back an hour everyday to get everything done. On
top of everything, I feel like I have ADHD and am keen to investigate
this and whether this is contributing to my struggles at work.

                    Hello. I am finding it really difficult to function atm. I have had
anxiety like this for 2 years. My husband and i own our own automotive
workshop, which I wanted to sell 9 years ago. So doing something I don't
want to has been a stress. Then his mental health and health problems
added to that. 2 years ago I hit a wall as one of our employees was
thinking of leaving, and I lost all thought and function. I rely on him
alot and panicked, but a week later with mods and some belt tightening
he stayed. Have had a few really good years and in a better position
then ever, then last year things slowed down and it flared up again, the
panic of going back to juggling everything, but all came good. No it's
happening again and this time it feels worse. I can't bring myself to do
my work and I just don't want to be here. It's been almost a week but
this is the 3rd day like this. I just want the panic to go away. I can
handle things without the panic. I don't know what I want from this but
I am trapped. BTW the business is on the market and has been for 2.5
years. Good business just no one has the cash. Thanks for reading if you
made it this far.

                    When I think about it, I've always had anxiety. But this year it has
spiked and made working very difficult. I am a teacher, and feel like
there is no space for mental health conditions. You can't just leave
your students for a quick break. You need to show up and put on a
facade. Every. Single. Day. Last year I found teaching and my general
life very easy and fulfilling. But this year, every day is so hard. I
bought a house at the end of last year and am struggling to make ends
meet. I've had a lot of sick leave without pay and can't keep doing
this. I started taking antidepressants at the beginning of the year and
don't feel like they are helping. I am experiencing depression and
suicidal thoughts, which I've never had before. I used to love life.
Part of me wants to run away, sell my house and live out of the car. But
I don't know how I can come back from that. Has anyone else had a
similar experience with antidepressants? How do you keep pushing through
the discomfort and go to work every day when it makes you physically
sick? I can't keep doing this for the rest of my working life.

                    Hi everyone, For the last month I have been suffering from panic attacks
(maybe anxiety). It is all very new to me and troubling. I have tried
breathing techniques ‘smiling minds’ and Dr prescription medication,
which is helping. Next step was a psychologist but none are available
right now. So I tried a self help group in my area. It was a very
rewarding time and would recommend it. My question, is a self help group
a good substitute for a psychologist?

                    Hi, well what a few months it has been. Last Friday was the first
anniversary of my sisters passing and although it was difficult, it was
nice to be surrounded by family. It did bring up a lot of feelings and
emotions though. lots of sadness, anger why it had to happen at all and
I miss her dearly. On top of that work is getting worse by the day, the
constant behaviour management all day every day, the copious amounts of
reports, data collection and emails, the phone calls to parents, and
writing behaviour records. Then there is the everyday prep work to be
ready for lessons. It is never ending and it is nothing for me to
complete another 4+ hours of work at home each night. So how is my
mental health in all of this?? Not great. I feel like I am slowly
drowning - the water level is lapping at my chin and soon I won't be
able to breathe. I am attending therapy once a week and whilst it helps,
its the days in between that are difficult. Some days I just want to
stand on a mountain somewhere and just yell and scream until I feel
better. And other days I just want to crawl up in a ball and cry my eyes
out and wait for the world to pass on by. I am in two minds about
returning to my doctor and going back on anti-depressants. I stopped
taking them about 6 months ago. Anyway, I should probably try and get
some sleep......

                    I find it extremely difficult to hold down a Job for years. If I tell
you about my past maybe this might help with someone trying to
understand. I lived over seas for some of my child hood until coming
down to Australia and being placed in a boarding school. I was diagnosed
with ADD when I was very young and I also have a very low borderline IQ.
So learning new information and keeping up with the speed of this crazy
world is difficult for me. I've never been a selfish person or a greedy
person. I just thought that if I could put my problems out there someone
would be able to understand, or if they feel the same way towards my
thoughts. I was only told of my limitations around 5 years ago by my
parents (I'm now 40 years old) I find it difficult to read and retain
information too. I've accepted my fate and I'm seeing a psychiatrist how
ever the medication does not seem to be working so now we are trying
psycho therapy soon. I get easily influenced by people as you can
imagine, with having a low IQ so problem solving skills are not good.
I've given up on the world and I've accepted my fate. I'm not adapting
to this crazy world and I've struggled my whole life with absolutely
everything. I hope someone out there is able to understand or share
there experiences which are similar to mine. I've found the transition
from childhood to adult hood absolutely crazy and I've been trying to
keep up with the world, but frankly have given up.

Any ideas will be welcome.I have a fair amount on my plate like a lot of
people including being a carer for 2 family members both of whom I live

to deal with the NDIS which is an ongoing burden which I cannot say is
easy.I Have also retired recently after a fulfilling 42 year career so
finding that a bit difficult as well.Any how I hope someone can make a

                    Hello to everyone this beautiful Sunday, I have woken up with a stress
headache once again, caused by one person who has been vile to deal
with. (He is a customer not family) All of last week he was deliberately
complaining about absolutely nothing, being abusive towards me and my
staff. He was deliberately causing confusion and mixing up orders to
test me and my staff. To test our service. Calling late at night and
becoming an absolute nuisance of himself. I mean calling at 10pm on
Friday to complain. I was already in bed trying to recover from the
harassment I had been subjected to all week. Yesterday I was having an
anxiety attack because of not sleeping and this morning, Sunday,
Mother’s Day, he started again. The phone calls from different numbers,
the messages and videos and voice messages, he sent emails at 11:30pm to
stress me out about nothing. A error of his own making. And again
calling staff this morning to place an order and then call 30 minutes
later to cancel it. Just to create unnecessary work. Why are some people
like this? I want to scream every expletive I can think of at him but I
have to bite my tongue as he’s threatening to post nasty poor reviews of
my service online. Tomorrow, I will be telling him that I can no longer
provide with any service as he’s threatening to cancel his account
anyway. I want to tell him that I don’t need his business. What is wrong
with someone like that? I haven’t cried yet, but I feel like punching a
pillow and just imagining it’s his face. I want him to know how much
stress he’s caused me to a point of breaking down today. I’m exhausted.
Thank you everyone for listening to my rant. Fiatlux 🫶

                    Hi! Just putting this all out here to see if anyone can relate because
I’m quite stuck and really struggling and nobody close to me understands
what I’m going through. I developed health anxiety November last year (7
months ago), I’ve always been scared of death but this is a whole new
extreme, i started having panic attacks daily that eventually turned
into a 24/7 panic attack that lasted 8 weeks, my mum had a brain
aneurysm when i was 6 that burst, i was meant to get a brain scan at 18
because they can be hereditary but i put it off until November and I’m
now 20. As soon as i had the scan done is when the panic started, I
convinced myself I was about to have a brain aneurysm burst, I wouldn’t
leave my room, didn’t sleep, couldn’t eat, could not function for 8
weeks and was stuck in a constant panic. I went to emergency multiple
times and had 7 doctors tell me the scan was clear and still I wouldn’t
believe them. About a week after I accepted the fact my brain was okay a
relative passed from a heart attack, he was in his early 30s (has had
major health issues his whole life) this then made me convinced that I
was going to have a heart attack, still to this day and it is so
debilitating cause once again i can’t sleep or do anything, i don’t go
out anymore, i won’t go further than 10mins from my house and won’t even
go into shops. It has gotten a lot better than at the start, once again
multiple trips to emergency, multiple ECGs and been told countless
amounts of times my heart is fine and healthy and i’m also very young
still. Now one of my friends went into anaphylaxis from almonds randomly
with no previous allergies, now i’m to scared to eat and when i do eat
my anxiety convinces me im going into anaphylactic shock I just really
need some support or advice because this has gotten so out of control
and I just want it to stop
                "

                    First of all, I can acknowledge that I have come a long way since
hitting the depths of rock-bottom a few years ago. And this forum
helped. I sought therapy, got some life managing tools, turned a corner
when I left a toxic job and since then, have experienced a healthier
mental headspace and over body shape. My problem is....how quick I
spring back to hating myself, blaming myself for everything,
highlighting my failures and being uncomfortable with any positive
validations - I feel dishonest like I'm fooling people. Am I addicted to
anxiety? Is the daily effort, to ignore the self critic in my head, for
the rest of my life? Because thats too much work. I get acknowledged at
work or someone praises me, I list things that I do wrong instead. And
I'm such a friggin dweller. Cannot move on from a mistake or a comment I
made even though noone is bringing it up and hasn't caused consequences.
I can't sleep. I can't function. And I have a great network of family
and friends around me but I feel selfish to burden them with I'm not
coping with Life. I feel like a failure at everything. I hate myself. I
annoy myself. I'm surrounded by a network of supporters but I feel
selfish to lean on them. Why cannot I feel joy, be grateful...why is it
easier to accept I'm a waste of space, im fooling everyone that I have
my shit together .I'm not house proud, don't do enough homecooked
dinners, I'm on the phone lost in cyberspace where I can be helpful or
liked, instead of cooking and cleaning for the family. I always make a
good impression and then I retreat. Like I'm going to give you reasons
to not like me. This affects Work. I come in as a social butterfly and
then I start second guessing my ability to do the work, start thinking
I've disappointed everyone and I just spiral. My Manager said last year
""you're not the same person we interviewed"". She didn't mean it in a
negative way at the time. She was encouraging me to be kinder to myself.
I. Have.Not. Let.That.Go. I feel guilty like I started working there on
false pretenses. Sometimes I feel like I'm playing so many different
roles that when I'm alone I realise the real me is the one I hate the
most. Pathetic, lazy, unorganized...I've convinced myself that whatever
anyone else sees is an illusion. So that being said what do I need to do
to feel better about myself? How do I switch of that inner self critic?
And do I just embrace I live with anxiety and whatever tools work, yes,
I'm going have to use them every day for the rest of my life? I need the
second phase of my life to look different. I don't want to be a burden
to myself and others anymore. I want to feel lighter. I want to see the
positive and lean into it. Most of all, I just want to be able to say
""Oops. Noted. Moving On."" I hate living in my head. I hate that I know I
have plenty to be grateful for but feel unworthy of it. I hate I didn't
pursue my dreams because I wasn't good enough so I seek impossible
perfection in everything that I do - deliberately I guess, to remind me
I failed to be successful. I hate that I've taken up someone's time
reading this rant when they probably have bigger problems than me
feeling defeated by Me. All I know it is a horrible feeling to close
your eyes and feel nothing but hate and anxiety towards yourself. I've
been told I'm a good wife, mum, friend, colleague, relative....instead
of feeling joy, I'm devastated that I've duped them somehow. If I'm
destined to live like this just please help me with the spiraling? How
do I stop the negative cycle in my head from snowballing? I want to
sleep. I want to proactive around the home. I want to give Work the
hours it requires and switch off and go be present with my family. I
want to be more present with my family and friends. I want to feel joy.
I want to look around me and everything and everyone that I love is
around because I deserve it. That's it, I guess. How do I feel worthy of
my life?

                    Hi, I'm new here and came with the need to rant so please don't mind me
as I do. I currently have many problems in my life that give me anxiety
but there is only so much I can talk about, so I guess I'll share one of
them here since I have no one to talk to. I have been wanting to get
this off my chest because its been eating me inside and been giving me
so much stress. I am a student currently living by myself and have been
experiencing financial stress over the last couple of months to the
point where I have been skipping meals and just barely making my rent. I
am someone who does not make friends easily and only have one friend
group which also happens to be my classmates at uni. One of them in
particular comes from a wealthy family and everyone knows her as ""the
rich one"". I consider her my friend but I know deep down that I am
jealous of her because I can't help but compare myself to her. Unlike
me, she is a very fortunate and lucky person who somehow always gets the
best opportunities that I don't. She's a talkative person that likes to
flex and sometimes overshare the good things in her life. Couple months
back, when I saw her the first day back to school, the first thing she
told me was how much money she made during the break and how rich her
company was. It makes me feel bad about myself because I know I can't
share my financial struggles with her and I always think about how much
of a failure I am compared to her. I know she doesn't mean harm and is
actually a sweet girl, but sometimes her flaunting is annoying and gives
me unnecessary stress. I remember one time I got very annoyed at her
because she tried to give me ""advice"" on how to act and do my job better
when I was actually the one who had more work experience and a higher
qualification than her. She's also part of our close friend group and I
realized that most of my friends actually like her more than me, which
makes it even more discouraging for me. I don't want to feel this way
and I know its not good to compare myself to others but it's so
difficult not to feel inferior around her. I don't want to lose my
friend group as they will be with me until I graduate so I try to endure
it but I am suffering. I am trying my best to earn money to get out of
my financial situation but I know that I will never reach the same level
as my friend and I can't help but feel like I'm not enough and that I
will always be in financial stress.

                    Hello and thank you for all, It is difficult to get your thoughts down
on the page when you are anxious and depressed. You lose your
assertiveness and ability to say what you what to say. I'm Nick, guy who
is middle age, and I have a diagnosis of social anxiety and depression,
from my early 20s. I've just started a teaching placement which will go
until the end of May, 4 days a week. Today is the second day and I've
called in sick, but I'm not. I get stressed, emotional and anxious in
any new situation, not just this one. I am very sensitive to criticism,
and I have a history of getting fired from jobs, because of
non-attendance and making mistakes. I feel deflated and sometimes will
start crying when I think about my life. Luckily, I have a great Mum and
Dad, brother and sister-in-law. My parents are both in their 80s, so I
take this into account when talking about my mental health. To be clear,
I will talk to them, and they will notice, when I am not well, but I
think about their health and worry. The medication I take 'seems' to
work at times, but my mood can be volatile and I don't deal well with
criticism. I have used CBT to work through things, but it is not enough.
I am not bipolar, I don't exhibit manic behaviours. I am not sure what
else to say, as I feel sluggish in my thoughts, and want to rest now. I
appreciate those who have read what i have had to say, and hope you are
ok. Nick

                    Has anyone realised this, and restarted in a completely different field?
How did you do it - or the reverse, did you think that but it ended up
ok? I’m so unhappy and stressed all the time, work becomes my entire
life. My work is high pressure in that deadlines can be very demanding,
but it’s also quite complex and means dealing with lots of different
people who have different views etc. I’m a people pleaser and a bit of a
perfectionist so that really is challenging for me. I keep imaging an
escape and it’s always something like a wildlife rescue in the country,
or even a florist, or a librarian, or anything else. I feel like I’m
just not cut out for my work - everyone says how good I am it but they
don’t see the toll that it takes on me? I feel like resigning, ending my
lease, moving somewhere and just escaping it all but I can’t do that
financially. I doubt I’d ever have the courage or follow through as
well, I’m terrible with decisions and just get paralysed and do
nothing.I also don’t trust myself though, like is this just me in the
moment? Would another job just be exactly the same, because it’s about
how I react to things? Would being somewhere totally new and alone with
no one really be the best idea?

                    Hi all, I'm new to this and looking for some advice for some one that
has been through what I'm going through. To keep it short it started
about 3 months ago now, I went to see my Dr with a bit of chest
discomfort and as my heart rate was elevated he called an ambulance to
take me straight to the closest hospital. Upon arrival they did a ecg,
ct scan and blood test which all came back clear. They desided to admit
me into the cardiovascular ward as my heart rate was still over 100.
From there I was monitored 24 hrs, had another ct scan and an
echocardiogram all which came back normal. A month later I was back in
the emergency department as I had my first heart palpatation that felt
like my heart was jumping around, to me it felt like I was having a
heart attack. They did bloods, ecg and it all came back normal, however
they wanted me to conduct a holter monitor test. I did the test and it
came back that I had 24 pre beats in the 24 hr period and that my heart
was perfect from an electrical side of house. Since then I have now been
checking my pulse religiously as I have felt weird pains and tightness
around my chest, tightness in my neck, light headed from time to time,
have even noticed a visible heart beat in the hollow part of my neck. I
have even started to notice that some times when I'm standing up for a
period of time my heart rate remains over 100 even though other times it
has returned to normal. Since then I have had a few panic attacks and
developed anxiety over this. My issue is that even though I have been
told and reassured from my Dr that every thing is fine with my heart, to
me it still fells like something is wrong especially when I notice my
heart rate doing weird things and or feeling the physical symptoms as I
have mentioned earlier. I've tried hard to believe what the Drs tell me
but I still can't shake the feeling or thoughts that there is something
wrong. This is starting to control my life as all I do is worry about
it. Any help or advise would be greatly appreciated.

                    Hi everyone, I don’t know if this will help but I feel like I need to
get this off my chest.. I am in my 20s and I feel overwhelmed and
anxious all the time, I don’t know what to do. I have talked to a
professional a couple of years ago after a panic attack (never had one
before) but her advice was not helpful and it’s just getting worse. I
have been feeling ill lately, I’ve seen my GP about it and she did a
heap of test that came back ‘unremarkable’. It’s been 2 or 3 months and
she is out of tests to run on me so I keep feeling sick. I am wondering
if it is my anxiety that’s causing the issues and if it is I feel like
there is no hope of getting better. On top of that I feel undervalued
and not challenged at work but I am too worried to talk to my manager. I
struggle falling asleep every night and wake up a lot too. I have
chronic headaches that have been more like migraines lately. I feel
tired and unmotivated and things that I used to like don’t seem
enjoyable anymore. I thought about going to my GP to get a mental health
care plan but I am so worried about the cost involved with all of that
and also don’t believe it would help anyway. I get too emotional most of
the time and feel like I’m either really happy or really sad. I don’t
like to leave my house alone so I never do anything when my fiancé is at
work, I don’t have any friends and I don’t talk to my family as much as
I should but I have nothing to talk about so I don’t want to bother
them. I don’t know what to do and I feel like I’m venting too much.

received a lot of replies to their posts. Our community champions work
very hard to make sure that all newbies are welcomed when they first
post, and we understand that it’s a big step to post for the first time
on a forum like this, especially if you aren’t feeling great. It’s
important to remember, though, that these forums are a community of real
people, just like you, not a one-on-one support environment like going
to see your psychologist. To get the best out of being here, one of the
best tips we can offer is give support to receive support. Being a good
community member means: participating in different threads (not just
your own), replying to people who have taken the time to reply to you

support and encouragement when you see others who are hurting and
reaching out. You don’t have to feel obliged to solve the problems of
others: that’s not what we’re here for. But you can offer empathy and
what you’ve learned from your own life experiences, even if it’s just a
line or two, eg. “I don't know what to say, but I want to give you my
support and tell you I care about what is happening to you and hope life
will get better soon.” Try to develop an interest in the journeys of
others here on the forums. You may be surprised at how good being an

                    Hi EveryoneI have suffered from anxiety and depression since I was a
kid, I am now in my mid 30's and I just find myself feeling more lost
and overwhelmed, as each day passes, by everything and everyone.Nothing
seems to get easier, only harder!My mother is a narcissist, my partner
of 10 years is possibly bi-polar (I say possibly because I was told he
was diagnosed before I met him but went off his medication because he
didn't think he needed it) and I dare not bring it up with him, and I
work with someone on a daily basis who is a worker like me but seems to
think it is their duty to micro manage me because they can't cope unless
everything is the way they want (ocd!)I constantly feel like I am
fighting a losing battle with everything, feeling like I am standing
there just digging the biggest hole underneath myself and soon it's
going to be too big for me to get out of. I feel as though I'm
constantly being watched and scrutinized, as though I'm not allowed to
have a voice, or if I make a choice, it's wrong. Is there anyone else
out there who has similar issues? or who feels like this? How do you
cope / get through each day?Best wishesLost Soul

                    Hello everyone, I can't believe it's been 6 years since I last posted
here! In that time we have all been through a pandemic which challenged
us all, and I have lost my my beautiful brother to cancer. My anxiety/
panic attacks settled down for awhile and I actually felt like I got my
life back. But, here we go again and this time I cannot cope, its
relentless, not so much panic ( which is a blessing) but anxiety each
and everyday! I hate the morning's, I wake after only managing 4 hours
of sleep with anxiety, racing heart, palpitations, shakes, sick to the
stomach and there really is no reason why. I miss my brother terribly,
we spoke everyday and as he was a sufferer too he got me, now he is gone
I have a loving family but I just want to wake up and be happy with what
the day will bring. Im seeing my doctor regularly and a psychologist and
come away from the appointments feeling positive but then another day
starts and so does the anxiety. My doctor has changed my medication to a
new one and it's only been 7 days on, I know they take time to work and
I'm probably expecting a miracle. But this time around I can't see light
at the end if the end of the tunnel. I have a 21 year old son who is
suffering terribly with OCD and other issues, he misses his uncle badly
too. Im trying to stay strong for him, but feel I'm falling apart.

                    My therapist has recommended I undertake study in a course that more
suits 'me' in order to help me find what I enjoy, find my 'dream job''
(if that even exists?!) and 'make me come alive' ... in hopes to also
bring me out of a depressive state and hopefully my quarter life crisis.
The course I have chosen and enrolled into is a Diploma of Design (which
gives me the option to study subjects in Graphic Design, Fashion,
Interior and Game Design) my passion (I think) is Graphic, Fashion and
maybe Interior, however I am one of those indecisive people and can
never seem to pick something and I like to have variety (even in my job
too), so hence why this course appealed to me. The things I am
struggling with is self doubt, pessimism, lack of confidence and feeling
like I am wasting my time with studying this course as it is in industry
that doesn't have a lot of stability, which is something I have always
wanted so hence why I chose another path when finishing school. I know
my parents have steered me away from this area as 'where would that
lead??', ''whats wrong with where you work now?'' ''why can't you just
be happy so that way people can see that you are happy in life and
approach you to date'', ''change your attitude'', ''be grateful''
,''pray about it - what does God say?'' etc. I am feeling overwhelmed as
I haven't studied since 2017 and also a brief attempt at uni which I
pulled out of early on due to, well similar reasons and finding it too
hard (Diploma of Business. I work in Admin & Customer Service for the
past 10+ years), so this time I feel more pressure to make this work and
I want to push through my mindset issues and see if this might lead
somewhere. I have fallen rusty on time management skills in the last few
years also and can't even keep my room clean like I used to, get up
early enough to style my hair and put on makeup. This is due to my bad
habit of being on my phone too much, I could achieve so much if I wasn't
on my damn phone!! however I also use it to set reminders, timers,etc to
help me stay organised too it is a double edged sword.I also find myself
getting distracted easily and am not a fan of reading, I never was in
school either. When I read and I lose focus and forget what I was
reading, my eyes dry up and/ or I fall asleep, so that is another worry
I have as well. Trying to stay disciplined and positive to persevere
through it all! My course to due to start in a month and its online and
I am getting increasingly overwhelmed and feel like I want to tap out,
but I don't know how to push through. Breathing techniques I haven't
found to be helpful, they seem to make my thoughts louder and I feel
like it is all too much. Almost like I need to get everything right
before I can proceed to the next task. I find myself asking what is
wrong with me? Why can't I do even a simple task??

                    Hi and thank you for reading..I have been a long time sufferer of
anxiety and depression. I have written before so i hope im not overdoing
things. I recently applied for a position as a ward assistant at a
hospital where im currently volunteering a few hours a week. I had an
interview online last week and have yet to hear anything. The whole
process is maxing out my anxiety issues to the point that im not sure if
i could even handle the position even on a one or two day basis that i
mentioned in my interview. I have been honest and mentioned my problems
on my application. It just makes me so scared about where im heading ..
Im 58 and worked since i was 16 and im just tired this anxiety . I
wonder if anyone has had similar feelings or any thoughts. Best wishes
to everyone Brett.

                    As long as I can remember I’ve always struggled to keep a friend for a
long time. I’m 16, just left high school early a couple months ago to do
nursing. I don’t talk to anyone I did sports with or went to school
with. I’ve been waiting for that to start to make like minded friends
but that’s just been pushed back another 4 months. I try talking to old
friends from my high schools but I fall onto deaf ears, and I know it’s
not necessarily me but the different positions in life we’re in and
experiences so we don’t have much to talk about. I feel like I’m in such
a hole, I don’t have the energy to go out and make friends- even if I
did, I find myself shying away out of fear I’ll be “too loud” or “too
much” as previous friends have suggested. I know I’m digging my own
lonely hole, I’m 16- I feel like I should have more friends than just my
mum( she’s 17 years older than me so she’s like a sister) though she’s
awesome.. it’s just not the same. I want someone to hangout with,
sleepovers, go out to the beach or stuff like that. I don’t know what I
should be doing anymore tbh. So Im writting this, if anyone’s been there
what did you do?thank you for spending your time to read

                    About six weeks ago my partner of five years (on/ off again) decided to
separate for good. We were both very upset (lots of crying/expression of
love ) . I feel incredibly sad, unable to stop crying these last few
weeks. I recently got a job offer (dream job) in another state. My ex
and I were potentially planning on moving to this state together. I
accepted the job, but am feeling so overwhelmed as I am moving away from
family into a new state/city where I have never been and do not know
anyone. Not to mention it's a move that really finalises/closes the door
on my relationship with my ex. The past couple of weeks, I have felt
such acute anxiety (especially at night). I know a certain level of
anxiety is normal as moving somewhere new, away from your family is the
'unknown'. But this feels so amplified by the loss of the presence of my
ex in my life. I feel utterly lost. Staying feels unbearable as there
are so many memories here and I fear sliding into a stagnant state. And
moving is terrifying as I know I will feel isolated and lonely for a bit
of time. Has anyone ever moved interstate after a breakup? What helped
you cope with feelings of loss, anxiety, loneliness? Thanks for reading.

continuously make comment about my career prospect saying im underpaid
why I'm working so hard. This stress me out, I like my job and don't
care with the pay. He also doubt the importance the role of my job, he's
a higher up and I'm a technician. He does all the calling and I did all
the background and paperwork. Does this mean my job is of lower
importance than his. His communication often highlight this as the case
Do you guys consider this bullying or harrasment as its impacting my

                    Hi there ,my first time putting anything up on a discussion board but
feel for the younger people dealing with OCD, i was diagnosed with Pure
O OCD three years ago when i was 50 and not going to lie it was an
extremely challenging period in my life with a brief stint in hospital,
but as challenging as therapy was and is eventually there can be a
freedom that can help release you from the prison within your head . it
was only after being diagnosed that i was able to look back and see how
much of my life was driven by OCD , the best advice i was given at the
time was to educate myself on OCD first as i think that is a massive
step forward to be able to understand what is OCD , second and the
absolute most important thing was to find a therapist that is
experienced in dealing with OCD as lots claim it but i dont believe some
are well enough trained in that specific disorder , the third thing for
me was being able to open yourself up at therapy and do the work as OCD
is very paradoxical , facing your fears with the help of your therapist
i believe was the best way , i wanted to write this for the people new
to this disorder to give them so hope so that they can find the courage
to seek help and move forward and not let OCD dictate their lives, there
will be some difficult days but they will get better ! three years ago i
was on medication and having rigorous therapy and now i am off
medication and touch base every now and then with my therapist and feel
much better , OCD along with Depression still challenge me but i have
the tools and the understanding of the disorder to calm myself down much
quicker , there is light at the end of the tunnel you just have to make
the first step, to the people caring for someone with OCD remember if
you find it hard, imagine how they must be feeling not being able to
understand themselves , so i tell you, you only need to help them by
being understanding and not necessarily having to understand the
condition , i think it is also important that the people caring for them
get up to speed on the best way of helping an OCD person as it will be
just as difficult for you because often it will require you not to offer
reassurance.anyway i wish everyone here who is suffering to go and get
help because it is there and whilst not perfect it will help ALOT !!

                    Hi, first time poster. I have been dealing with a toxic manager who does
not provide support to me at all. I dread coming to work everyday, with
massive anxiety, panic attacks, heart palpitations and feeling like
vomitting before work. I know I shouldn't let it affect me this much but
it does. She belittles me, points out everything she thinks I do wrong,
when I try to stand up for myself with all the accusations she has
against me, I am shut down and she makes excuses pinning things back on
me. I know I am not in the wrong, that I know, because I do the work
that is given to the best of my abilities but it's not my fault the work
lacks direction and clear expectations which then leads her to say I'm
not doing the job right.. anyway it sucks because I'm not financially
stable to quit my job. I'm also trying to find new jobs too but no luck
so far. This anxiety is sometimes getting too much it's affecting my
personal life (lost of appetite, being distant to friends/family) and I
don't know how to handle it while I'm still here.. I don't know how to
handle such a toxic manager who doesn't hear me out or sets me up for
success.. any advice would be great, thanks.

                    I’m in a relatively new job, been there 2 months. Work in a school so
just had the last 2 weeks off for school holidays. The last 2 days
before the holidays I had off due to legit sickness (stomach bug) then a
reaction to my new anxiety meds (I assume) and a panicked late night
phone call to a friend to come over because I thought I was dying
(biggest panic attack I have ever had). I just now over the phone turned
down an extra days work a week (that I had agreed to before the
holidays) as I desperately feel the need to have a day to myself (single
mum of a toddler, plus an exhausting & emotional few years - mum passed
away, had to move house twice, completed a course qualification, and
being a single mum with very very little support). Anyway, due to go
back to work tomorrow and I just don’t want to! But I’m not even sure
why. I know I haven’t done anything wrong by taking legit sick days, I
know I haven’t done anything wrong my turning down an extra days work.
Still, thinking about those things makes me panic.And, I don’t even like
the job… I’m looking at other employment opportunities. If I had to
blurt out a reason, I feel it’s the people.. and again I can’t pinpoint
why. There’s a few personalities that I just can’t take to, and am
somewhat ‘fearful of’ for lack of a better term.I do have a bit of
stress trauma from being bullied in a previous position back in 2012.I
just hate feeling this way! Makes memiserable, panicky, scared and
really sad…. and I bet I won’t sleep well, if at all tonight. Thank you
for taking the time to read this, any advice would be amazing

                    Is there anyone else out there who has been diagnosed with OCD? If so,
have you had to struggle with asking questions repeatedly and have
frequent conversations about the same things? Does this annoy others? if
so how do you deal with it?

                    My husbands siblings have organised a holiday together without even
asking us, it’s made me really upset. I feel bad for my husband as he’s
such a nice guy and would never want to leave anyone out. It’s now hard
to act like everything is normal around them, I just don’t know what to
do. I feel like distancing myself but is that the right thing to do?
Sounds like a small issue but I don’t know why it’s made me upset.

                    Hello, I'm coming here because I couldn't really find anything else, and
this happens pretty much every time something like this happens. I'll
just be looking at messages/gc's and sometimes I'll see that someone's
unfriended me. I think all of the cases have been people I don't really
know all too well, but it makes me feel awful. I question all of my past
interactions with the person trying to just understand why, like if I
did something wrong I'd wanna apologise because that wouldn't have been
my intention! I know that usually it's for some other reason and that
the person probably doesn't spitefully hate me, but like it really wears
on me, and I usually can't sleep for ages or even do other things. I
guess what I'm asking is there anything I can tell myself or any ways to
stop thinking about this, since it ultimately doesn't matter but yeah...

                    I dont know what to do honestly, its been two years and im still anxious
and paranoid, people know my real name and face and they harassed me
with it two years ago and im still anxious about it because they called
me a pedo for liking anime girls, i was 16, i couldnt of been at all,
and it just.. stuffs with my mind so much, I'm not anything they say I
am but it bleeds into everything i think about, they got my name and my
face on that discord server and who knows what they're saying now about
me, it's like a herpes virus it just infects everything i see and i cant
take it anymore, i'm lucky a few friends in that community helped me and
defended me but i dont know, i feel like i dont deserve anything nice at
all, everyday i wake up and i think about what they think of me, i'm
only just 18 and i feel like my life is ruined.

                    Hi! Does anyone else feel so anxious about uni, I feel as though I’m not
good enough, not smart enough! I have poor time management skills and my
anxiety causes me to procrastinate! Leaving assignments late and
therefore I stress!! I know this is a common feeling but if any of you
have anxiety and also study let me know of any tips that help you feel
motivate and strive! I’m really feeling the stress right now being mid
semester and all. Comparing myself to other students and doubting myself
a lot…. I need advice on how to overcome my negative thoughts. Thank
you!

                    Hi everyone! This morning I had a breakdown, the feeling of a ‘dirty’
house got the best of me. If I see a small piece of dust, toothpaste on
the sink, footprint on the floor or even a smear on the kitchen sink I
get an urge to fully clean by entire house. This morning, I tried to let
it go. My husband was wanting to go out and as I was doing my hair I
noticed how desperately the basin in the ensuite needed a wipe. Then I
noticed the dust on the window sill, the basket of dirty washing. As I
walked to the kitchen I noticed the coffee cup on the sink I’d just
cleaned, then the floor the needed a vacuum. I tried to let it go, but I
had a hot flush, my hands started shaking, legs feeling weak and my mind
racing. I said to my husband that I couldn’t go, I needed to clean the
house. Not just wanted to.. needed to. I can’t relax or enjoy life until
I know my house is clean. I could tell he was annoyed, he can’t see what
I see. He tells me the house is spotless and continues to leave. But I
can’t, I can’t be calm and happy until the house is clean. And not just
tidy, clean, not one bit of dust. Everyone comments on how clean our
home is. I think this contributes to my need to uphold this reputation.
please, any advice or help on this would be greatly appreciated. I
haven’t seen a professional about this or received any kind of
diagnosis.

                    I’ve been struggling with my life for the past 7-8 years but I finally
made an appointment with a doctor. I feel really scared though because I
don’t ever go to the doctor for anything, and I havent seen this doctor
for so many years that I’m really scared that they’ll judge me or won’t
believe anything I say. I’m really anti social so I feel like I won’t be
able to say what I wanna say or I’ll say the wrong thing causing them to
just dismiss me and move me along without helping. I’m just tired of
feeling alone, depressed and just worthless but I’m really scared to
talk to them.

                    My 14 year old daughter has been diagnosed with depression, which has
worsened in last two months due to her bf of almost a year ending
relationship and blocking her on every platform. Her school reluctance
worsened last term and she started on medication which didn’t rectify
but certainly made her a little better. Sadly two weeks ago she met a
16yo boy who is telling her everything she wants to hear while giving
her access to drugs/alcohol. Two weeks ago, she didn’t return home after
shopping as planned and we had to get police involved as she’d switched
off her phone. We don’t know any of the kids she’s hanging out with as
they’re from 30-60 mins away from home and obviously in different
schools/years. The police went to meet daughter for welfare check and
she said she’s not coming home, my husband took her mobile from her in
frustration so we very reluctantly agreed to come home. After a week of
making up to us, we agreed for her to go shopping with a girlfriend 8am
Saturday morning. She did not return until 3.15pm the following day. We
were worried sick but this time she did tell us she was safe with
friends (turns out she was with bf). Police say there’s nothing can be
done as crime not committed! That we actually don’t know but bf has sent
me a photo of his bed with caption ‘who doin wat’. Husband said he’s
taunting us as he’s lied to us since start about even being with
daughter. Now her school friends have said she hanging with wrong crowd
and don’t want to be around her anymore, this is pushing her further
away and she’s now refusing to go to school. Both dad and I are at a
complete loss. We spend time together, ferry her to and from
work/school. She turns 15 next week and we always do something extra
special for birthdays., some people say take everything away, some
don’t. Police said taking her phone away won’t solve problem. It’s just
heartbreaking at a time she needs her friends, they’re backing off yet
some of them helped her deceive us about where she was anyway!

                    1) Society only conceives themselves and they don't try to understand
others. Everyone's bias and no one can disagree with themselves
typically. 2) People either cause your problems, they otherwise don't
care, or they even potentially enjoy hearing about them with some. 3)
Advice and support is usually cliché, interaction is superficial, often
the only redirected recommendation is shrinks that leads to detrimental
pharmaceutical treatment and involuntary clients who feel invalided and
become victims. 4) I can't relate to my nationalities culture, only
since my generation globally is following a unified consensus to not be
interested or believing in Christianity Religion or with being all under
the same political left wing mainstream consensus. I find their
indisputable with any of their popularised views and they argue with
illogic. They project their insecurities too often and they can't have
as much meaningful or broaden conversation, everything's usually
awkward, weird, or whose cringe, a hipster, desperate and they feel
things are worth addressing. I don't like their music since 2008, their
too into Andrew Tate, women aren't prude. I only like older generations.
5) The 21st Century is horrible, people are high consumers and overt
materialist's, which than makes them more socially superficial, shallow,
narcissistic, insincere. Their less emotional courtesy and manners
today, people are more grandiose and with potential audacity to not
care, it's too much with financial net worth and being entitled. I don't
like globalism - diversity. 6) Everyone's more innocent until proven
guilty and they won't take needed accountability, they have no humility
to be wrong anymore, they treat sincerity and make it that your so
humble or rare, to normalise to feel & be mental, fake and laugh at
what's true or say that it's strange or weird, but to be guilty of the
same acknowledged things. 7) I couldn't relate to my father. I am a male
cultural misfit Christian Fundamentalist and my father is a generic
misogynistic that's chauvinistic, sexist. His got no issue with the
bloke culture in my opinion and he is stoic and selfish, His not
creative. He tries to vicariously live his sports team through me at
times and he diverts his illiterate limits onto me that I'm dyslexic.
His potential with rarer jealousy and puts his average mediocrity on a
pedestal with being the bread winner and the family bill payer. His
sister and family is narcissistic and with dysfunctional differences.

                    For a while maybe a year or 2 I'm not sure because i haven't kept count
but i have been feeling quite down and empty and alone, near the start
of the year i got into a relationship but in recent months i feel like
we're drifting apart and the lonely, sad and empty feelings are coming
back, whenever i comfront her about anything she spins it around to find
a way to make herself the victim and I'm just done with her, but the
main thing for me is these feelings I've been feeling, i don't know how
to express them properly or talk to someone about this, lot's of people
here say to see a professional, but being a minor and all it's hard to
go to a professional alone with the case of my parent's having my
medicare details, I'm most afraid of coming out to my parents about this
because i don't know how they will react or if they'll even believe me.
I have reached out to a friend and he recommended me to reach out using
a hotline so i found this site and decided to share here and i thought i
might as well share, i just don't know what to do with these feelings
and how to manage it without making obvious changes in my life that
people will notice, I'm highly scared about how others will react to me
feeling these things, especially the change in how people act towards me
once they know I'm struggling like this, so it just feels right taking a
leap of faith and getting advice from others here anonymously.

                    Hello... My brother suffers from Schizophrenia and has been on a DSP
since returning to Australia in 2011 and on the UK version whilst
residing in the UK for the 15 years prior to this. He is mid 50's now
and still lives with my parents who moved to Ireland 12 months ago. My
mum contacted Centrelink to ask about the portability of both their aged
pensions and his DSP and was told that they would be able to continue.
What she wasn't told was he should have had a review before leaving in
order to 'secure' his DSP and after four weeks of leaving his pension
has been stopped. He has had nothing for the past year. He has never
worked and has never lived alone and in order to reinstate his pension
Centrelink have told him he needs to be re-assessed by a Dr in Ireland.
His new Dr advised my mum (who acts on his behlaf) that there is no way
he could provide the level of detail required to complete the
documentation. We appealed the centrelink decision which was
unsuccessful based upon the 4 week rule and I now have an Administrative
Appeal Tribunal hearing on Tuesday to challenge the decision again. If
this is unsuccessful which I fully expect it to be as they are only
focusing on the 4 week rule I'm wondering if I just have him fly back to
Australia.....re-apply which I would think would be accepted and then
once it's reinstated have him return to Ireland and his home with my
parents. It's brutal how they can cut someone off on a technicality and
provide no support around how to resolve a situation which is clearly
based on poor information and a minor oversight. No support provided and
I'm so angry. Just venting really and would be interested in anyone who
has had to reapply or had issue when moving overseas or with the AAT.
Thanks all.

                    This is a throw away account, as I'm embarrassed.I'm 32 years old, and I
don't have any friends, ambitions, and never had a relationship. As a
kid, I always felt like the black sheep of the family. Always feeling
like I'm in the shadows of my siblings. I had a very abusive mother
during my teen years, where I wasn't allowed out the house except for
going to school, wasn't allowed to have friends over, and never got to
experience dating. Everyday, I was told I was worthless, how nobody will
ever want to be near me, and my grandmother even wishing I committed
suicide. When I was finally old enough to get away, I felt I was thrown
into a world that I had no experience for. When I tried to meet people,
I was always targeted and felt unwelcomed. I was also constantly bullied
at my job. I attempted to do 2 activities I was very passionate about,
but eventually I was bullied out of those, with one of those involving
death threats and harassment. It was this harassment, that the few
friends I did make while at these places, no longer wanted anything to
do with me.Because of my very troubled upbringing, I am terrified with
meeting new people, especially women, as I don't want to be hurt again.
I've always been told that I wasn't good enough, that even if I did
manage to gain confidence, I still believe those words. My anxiety gets
so bad at times, that once another person gets aggressive with me, I
shut down. Very rarely in life have I felt I belonged. I always tried to
remember that old saying ""treat others how you want to be treated"" but I
don't get the same treatment that I share.There are more examples, but
long story short, I'm at that point where I don't know where I'm headed.
I want friends and a loving partner, but I'm afraid of people and find
it hard to trust people. I want to do those activities I loved before,
but scared about seeing those people again. When my anxiety and
depression happens, I really do feel like the words from my mother about
being alone forever and how worthless I am are actually true.

                    Hi all, I really need to reach out and talk about the issues swirling
around in my head. I have had depression for two decades now. I am on
anti-depressents which cause me to not feel much emotion at all. I just
feel numb. I also have OCD, specifically contamination OCD. My brother
peed on his hands once and used our fridge and, after 10 years since it
happened I have been so scared to touch it with my bare hands that I
always wear gloves in my own kitchen. I have pure OCD where thoughts can
come in and I don't necessarily have to do a compulsion to try and get
rid of them. My thoughts involve incest which disgusts me but I can't
get rid of them and it scares me. I am very worried about my future. I
still live at home because of my mental health and want to move out, but
rent is so expensive I would have to live with someone who I don't know.
Plus I am incontinent. This I'm sure has been caused by my depression
but who's to say. The urologists I've seen haven't been able to help.
I'm in a job I do well but I don't like. I don't know how to move into a
different role or what I would even do. I just feel stuck. I am unhappy
in my social life. I have barely any friends. I have never had a real
loving relationship. I am afraid I am unlovable in my current condition,
or if I am even able to love someone else with my depression and lack of
feeling emotion. I need some guidance. I don't know how I can change my
life. It feels like too many issues on top of each other which I have
battled for decades that hasn't gotten any better. I have seen
psychologists before with very limited success. I find it very hard to
see things through with them and I don't know why. Do I not want to get
better? Am I just so used to suffering? I'm so confused. Thanks for
listening.

                    Lately, I have been feeling so many feelings at once, i can't keep up
anymore. from being depressed, to being anxious, to feeling so lonely
that I can't even handle it anymore. and now the guilt that I have now
relapsed. I cry every day, struggle to get out of bed in the morning, i
need to talk to people but I have no one to talk to. So as a result of
everything, i'm just sufficating in my own life, my own body. and I feel
there is nothing i can do too help myself.This is not my first rodeo,
but for some reason it just never gets easier. no one understands me, or
cares or takes the time to really know how I am feeling, so I just give
up, I don't even care anymore.I am the friend that is always happy,
laughing, cheerful and I am always there for everyone, i really care for
those I love, and I alway make sure my friends are okay. but then I sit
back and think, who makes sure I am okay? who is caring about me?
because only 2 people know that I am not the happy and cheerful person
that I put on display.

                    Hi, first time every reaching out on BB. I have struggled with
depression for as long as I can remember that is more the 40 years. The
last 4 years have been hectic. Death of my mum, uncle, and grandmother
all in 12 months. And nothing simple all very complicated. Work has
changed and is making me crazier than ever. And then on the weekend
something dark came out of me after a few drinks, I attacked a person. I
fully snapped! This I have no excuse for but I cant understand how I
could do this to another person. Its now started the spiral of dark
thoughts. I have a loving family and all the good stuff in life, why is
this becoming so ugly now? I don't understand and I don't know how my
friends and family can ever forgive me on attacking another woman. Has
anyone out there snapped like this, I am a grown women who attacked
another women in a bar.

                    I'm not sure why I'm here and posting this now, it's almost 4 years
later... I feel like I was let down by my psychologist, because I really
spiralled under her care. I had seen my psychologist for some time back
in 2018 as I was suffering chronic fatigue and she helped me work
through the depression and stress and anxiety I dealt with in
association with the illness I was suffering, work stress and financial
stress from going part time. I got myself back to a good place through
CBT and her care. But I later got pregnant and then right after the
birth of my child I felt my emotions and mental health were extra
fragile with all that was going on for me, so I made sure to get my
mental health care plan up to date and was seeing my psychologist
regularly. Thing is, I actually sank into pretty awful post natal
depression, but my psychologist didn't pick it up, my GP did. I still
remember the shock on her face the following sessions... She had no
idea. I ended up going on antidepressants on advice of my GP, and I
can't really explain the dark dark place I sank into, but I am much
better now. I just still carry this disappointment that I had been
seeing my psychologist as I knew I was more vulnerable, and she still
missed it. Not sure if anyone will read this but thanks for listening if
so. I think the problem is that she has shaken my trust in psychologists
and now and then I find myself slipping a bit and want to see someone
but I can't trust anyone. Does that make sense?

                    The last few weeks I have been suffering. I was hired for a job to
become a manager, I was made to bring in new procedures and get the
place running better before I was announced. It was something I worked
hard for only to be deceived by the area manager. He promised 3 people
the role and then gave it to someone completely different. I took it
hard and found it hard to go into work for a couple of days. One day I
got half way there, felt really bad and had to turn around and go home
again. On my return to work he fired me with some excuse. I was one of
the hardest working staff there and always did a great job and got lots
of reviews. So I lost my job. Spent a couple of days unable to get out
of bed. Now struggling to find a new job, I've always been employable
and a great hard worker and it's really kicking me in the guts doing all
these applications for no calls. Now I am worrying about finances. My
girlfriend was supportive and got me feeling positive but now our
relationship is failing. At the start of the year I packed up, moved all
my things and sold off my appliances to get a place together. We were
living 1.5hrs apart. I sacrificed, changed from my stable job to one
that now screwed me over, moved to her area to make things easier and
now that is falling apart because she is unhappy I have boxes stored in
our garage that I haven't sorted and she wants it tidy. She knows I have
been through a horrible few weeks. But now putting more strain on me
while I am already down. I have no money to move and get my own place,
won't get a lease without work and I have no appliances any more. I feel
like I have nothing left and no value or self worth. I don't know why it
annoys me that we are having issues and she just goes to sleep so easy
while I am awake at 3am crying because my life is going nowhere.

                    Hi, and thanks for reading. My wife and I love each other very much, we
often hold hands and kiss etc, but since she became pregnant and gave
birth to our son her libido has practically vanished. Our son turns 3 in
a few weeks and it is a hard reality to confront, but it has been years
since she has been excited about getting intimate. She tells me daily
that she is the luckiest woman, and I know how much she loves me (with
all her heart), and I absolutely adore her, but when it comes to the
bedroom, it's all very one sided. We are intimate on occasion, 5 or 6
times in the last 12 months, but I know she is just doing it for me and
it doesn't have the emotional connection I would love. We've talked
about it, but when we do I can tell she feels very guilty, and that's
the last thing I want! She was diagnosed with depression and anxiety 4-5
years ago, and has regular counselling, and I know she has body image
issues (I find her very attractive but she doesn't find herself
attractive), I know that these are likely what are causing her low
libido, but I really don't know what to do. She would love to want more
sex, but I don't know if that is for my sake or hers at this point.
We've done work together on love languages and I've focused on showing
her love in ways that she likes the best, and she does the same, there's
just this one snag and it gets me down even though I know why it's
happening. People comment on how they wish they had a loving
relationship like ours, I know that there's no perfect relationship, but
it is hard to feel loved, and yet so unloved as well. I know that
mismatched libido is not uncommon, but I feel that ours is quite
extreme. I'm not really sure what the purpose of my post is actually, I
don't think that there are any easy fixes, I guess I want to put this
out there to let other people know that if they're going through
something similar, they're not alone. If anyone has any thoughts I'd
love to hear them (sorry for the essay).

                    Hi all. I just need to get this out somewhere. I am in a very dark
place. I feel as though someone is sitting on my chest and have so much
emotional pain yet feel numb at the same time. Im alone and lonely. I
hate myself and who I am. I am so tired of fighting to get well and when
I go to bed I pray to not wake up. I can’t keep going on like this. I
need to get better

                    Hello, I am a 14 (turning 15 later on in the year) year old girl who was
diagnosed with ADD (inattentive ADHD) and level 2 autism probably about
a year ago. Recently, a psychologist had me do a questionnaire and when
they got the results back, they told my mum that my answers showed I
could clinical depression. Honestly, I wasn’t too surprised, because
ever since the start of high school I have noticed my mood changing as
well as developing a ‘procrastination monster’ who stops me nearly
everyday from doing stuff from basic chores to having a quick, easy
shower. I think year 8 was the start of most of it: My attendance
started to get really bad because I would jump right into bed after
school, never get out, wake up in the morning realising I wasn’t ready,
then miss the bus. Neither my poor mum or myself could tell if I had a
serious problem or if I was just super lazy. Now that I’m in year 9, I
feel like I’m always moody, causing everyone to get stressed out and
then upset at me. When it gets bad, I often get thoughts of how nice it
would be for everyone if I disappeared: Mum would no longer have a
dramatic, sulky daughter, my sister would spend 80% less time having to
fight with an annoying older sister, and everyone would have a whole lot
less stressing out to do. I also don’t feel okay with my body. I stress
eat, or just eat when I’m bored. When I get lollies, I try to eat a few,
then end up eating the whole packet. When I feel gross, I desperately
want to exercise but the singular though drains me, just like mum asking
me to do the dishes. Why do I make it such a big deal? She spends all
her time at work just to afford food for my sister and I can’t even get
myself to do the dishes.. What kind of daughter am I? Part of me really
wants to help her, but it’s like there’s a weight that keeps me down on
the couch or in bed. Someone tell me, am I depressed? Am I
procrastinating? Is this just a symptom of ADD? Or am I just lazy? I
want to be able to save myself before I become so unbothered that I quit
all my favourite sports and never see anyone again. I don’t want to, but
I could stop taking care of myself entirely and disintegrate by decaying
in my own filth for too long. I think I amheading in that direction.
Someone please let me know if you have ever felt this way, because I
feel so selfish and stupid.

                    I have been suffering from depression since Feb, I have tired 2
medication and there has been complications with both of them, the first
one saved me back in 2020 when I had a physical and mental breakdown.
Everything goes back a difficult marriage which I have stayed in for
years. Which we couldn't have children and tonnes of fertility treatment
and crazy amounts of verbal and physical violence to a point I cracked
after a bad back injury and 18 mouths of hell happened I was on a
certain medication for months and didn't know what happening. I ended up
at my parents in bed crying all day and not knowing anything, then I
found a doctor that helped me who was train shrink and naturopathy and
she save me. Then 3 years later after being normal and off medication
for 18 months. I hurt my back again and flood of anxiety came and all
the problems started with the meds and not before long the depression
set in and marriage I rebuilt collapsed again and I'm back at my elderly
parents again off work for last month and not sure what to. Not on any
meds. Barely coping and maybe trying a third medication or maybe doing
tms treatment or going into a treatment clinic. My life is a mess always
crying and now have zero energy. That probably on half what happened in
the last 15 years with marriage and mental health. I just had to get
that off my chest. Thank you

                    I'm going crazy at the moment: My job sucks so much, I can never save
enough for my own home in the future. What are we actually working for?
To survive? Why survive a life when we never have time to live. I just
want a house with a garden to have loads of pets, at least then I can
work to support them. Now, I'm renting and not allowed to have pets
anywhere, it stresses me out and I have nothing to look forward to in
the future. I'm so sick of taking it day by day at the moment, when I'm
at work I would rather paint or do crafts, something that gives meaning
to myself, but I'm so sick of lowering my bar to find a little sliver of
something in the day to day to keep going. It all sounds like excuses to
me to keep going and it's all not good enough anymore for me.

                    hi everyone, i think i might be depressed, and i think i have been for
quite a while now. i am in my last year of high school and i really need
help. i want to see a psychologist but i dont feel comfortable talking
to my parents about it. they are also very expensive and i think there
is a long waitlist. i have a councillor at school, but i don’t really
want to talk to her about it. it feels weird talking about that stuff at
school, so i keep conversations with her a bit more surface level. what
should i do?

                    As I sit here at my laptop I ponder where to start and if this is just a
cry out for attention, I'm just a bit lost. Hello my name is David, I am
a gay male, I work as a mechanic/technician and have been for now, just
over 10 years. Due to the toxic and hostile nature of the industry and
trades it made it hard to be open about myself, I made the mistake of
never coming out, being true to myself and open with everyone. As time
went on, I could tell, even though there are nice people I work with, I
had to ""play"" along (playing ""straight""), come up with excuses or fake
stories if there was any questions I had to be quick thinking. This has
not put me in a great position as I've formed some friendships at work
over the years and no one really knows. Sad thing is, I need to get out
of the trade, at least out of this job. The stress and anxiety I
experience actually makes me sick in the morning and i go into a blank
frozen zone in my mind and just shake/panic attack, luckily I'm on meds
that help with that. This is already pretty full on, add to that I've
been suffering depression since probably early 2010's, ups and downs and
the downs have been gradually getting worse. I have a partner which I
proposed to in Japan last year when we were on holiday with friends,
that was a special time of my life (I really wanna go back to Japan too
haha). Add more to the mix of my messed up mind, I have issues a bit
with his weight only because it turned me off during you know what time.
And it really annoys me and makes me sad when i realise this. It's
something I can't help, like a natural impulse thing it's hard to
describe. He's working out, swimming, going for walks, getting a better
job and I couldn't be any more proud of him and I love him so much.
Sadly we haven't made love in probably years, I'm not kidding. It
actually hurts me that my mind just doesn't feel like it (anyone had
this?) I feel like I'm hurting him like I don't love him but it's not
true.. I have fear of getting older tied up with being a failure and
also a strong fear of change, finding a better job and new people etc. I
also haven't had good luck with any psychologist in the past, could be I
just haven't got the one that ""clicks"" with me but even to my own mind I
feel extremely complicated and it's stupid and actually pisses me off.
Sometimes I really want to escape it all, like spiderman no way home,
have nearly everyone forget i ever existed and start again.

made an appointment with a doctor. I feel really scared though because I
don’t ever go to the doctor for anything, and I havent seen this doctor
for so many years that I’m really scared that they’ll judge me or won’t
believe anything I say. I’m really anti social so I feel like I won’t be
able to say what I wanna say or I’ll say the wrong thing causing them to
just dismiss me and move me along without helping. I’m just tired of
feeling alone, depressed and just worthless but I’m really scared to

                    HiI've been reading many of your posts and loneliness seem to be a
common theme. I've never been able to articulate what loneliness means
to me until I read this quote: ""The story loneliness is much longer than
the story of life. In the sense of what most people mean by living.
Without children or partner, without meaningful family or a home, a day
can last an eternity: a life without those things is a life without a
story, a life in which there is nothing - no narrative dramas - to
alleviate the cruelly meticulous passing of time.The lack of tenderness
or intimacy, loneliness is when nothing will stick to you,, when nothing
will thrive around you, when you start to think that you kill things
just by being there.""

                    Hey for anyone who is reading this I'm turning 18 this year. I have been
diagnosed with autism, ADHD and depression since I was three years old.
I took medication since was three for the past 15 years of my childhood
life. I didn't notice these symptoms, well to explain it further they
didn't bother me as much, but my parents have suffered a ton of shit
from me when I was little, tantrums, excessive crying, and many more.
but apart from that I was the happiest I had ever been, so much joy that
I never felt sadness. As I grew older, at the age of 13-15 when my body
began to develop into a woman, hormonal emotions were coming out (which
was completely normal at the time) some days I would feel sad, angry,
tired and helpless. and when I got my first period I experienced typical
teenage mood swings, but as you know when a cycle is done those mood
swings tend to settle. However, my 'emotions' wouldn't go away, instead
they would grow stronger and develop bigger until I got so used to them
that it just ended up being normal. my parents questioned me if I was
bipolar or something because I had insanely crazy mood swings every five
seconds, but I just told them 'I was tired and its normal..' years go
by, and i'm age 16, I start to notice something different about myself,
something that I don't recognise anymore. It started small, like with
the crazy outburst of emotions, but then it lead to other things like;
not enjoying what I used to enjoy...for me it was (videogames) and even
when I tried to force myself into playing them, I didn't feel the
satisfaction that I used to when I played them. it wasn't just
videogames it was all my hobbies everything that defined who I was. it
soon came that I grew to a lack of motivation I didn't feel like
completing any daily activities that I used to do, I didn't feel like
moving an inch from my bed I just wanted to sleep and escape reality and
I didn't know why, by this I was angry and upset and confused. life
wasn't living for me and it still isn't now.. the worst part is I can't
figure out if this is just a normal teenage experience or heavy symptoms
of depression. and how do i fix this... how do i fix myself? how do I
just be normally happy?

                    Hi all,i cant believe im here, so difficult... guess ill explain the
best i can. I have always been a bit of a loner, never had a
relationship but have always been contented with that, i just figured i
was asexual and left it at that. i dont really mentally understand
intimacy? but a year ago i made friends with this amazing girl from the
US who was on a working visa for a year and we became best friends. We
both care about each other a great deal, it didnt get romantic but
honestly neither brought it up or cared we just hung out heaps and
enjoyed life, it was the happiest period of my life by a gigantic
margin. well her visa expired and she moved back to the states. I have
cried every day for a month now, and while we text daily its just not
helping to remove the pain at all... i need her in my life. i feel
hollow like a peice of me is missing and i cant get her out of my head
at all, im obsessed with seeing her again. is that love? ive never felt
it before.Am i depressed if im crying every day? I dont know if i should
tell her how much she means to me now that we are so far apart but at
this point im just really scared and just need another person to give me
an opinion on what to do. i dont have any scary thoughts, but the
sadness i live with at every moment is unbearable. thank you so much for
listening,Roman.

                    Recently I've been struggling with my sister and our relationship. Since
her wedding at the start of the year, she has brought up issues with me.
These issues came like an avalanche, without warning, and have derived
from issues which I had believed, were already solved. She has recently
given me an ultimatum, that I need to act according to her wishes, or I
will miss out on some of her events in the future. I feel as though my
sister doesn't want to understand me, or listen to what I have to say,
or even being open minded. It feels like a helpless situation. We live
in different states and a lot of our previous communication has occurred
via text or phone calls. I don't want to communicate via text anymore
because what I'm trying to say always ends up getting misinterpreted. We
are in gridlock at the moment.These past few months, I've been trying to
not think about it too much but underneath it all, I'm mourning the loss
of our previously close relationship. My sister is not in my inner
circle and I'm not in hers and this makes me feel sad. This conflict has
also impacted my other siblings and I feel guilty about this, as I never
wanted this conflict in the first place, or for it to impact anyone
else. At this stage, I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel and
I'm hurting.

                    Hi, I’m a 57 year old male. I came from an abusive step family
relationship and ran away from home at 15. I ended up being homeless and
drifted from shelter to shelter, state to state and couldn’t keep a job
or make friends. This lasted about 8 years. Fast forward 30 plus years
and I have a beautiful Wife, a lovely home,a good job and plenty of
money. So many trigger points remind me of my past and it depresses me
severely. As I get older it seems to get worse. I see homeless people on
the streets and it breaks my heart as I have been there. I try to ignore
the trigger points but they are so raw and overwhelming. I should be
happy for the fortunate position I’m in now, but my past is a huge
roadblock. Sometimes I wonder if going back to my past ways would ease
the pain.

                    I have been with my husband for 34 years and recently he has told myself
and our kids that he has had depression for the past 4 years, brought on
by a childhood trauma. The reason it came out was because he felt bad
about telling me a lie, which he then told me the truth and what he's
been going through. He has been speaking with a counsellor over the
phone through work, but he said he feels they are talking from a card.
He has seen his GP and is now waiting on an appt with a local
Psychologist who I found that deals with Trauma/PTSD.For the past few
years I have felt a shift or a difference in his and our relationship
but thought I was causing it all because my Peri Menopause has coincided
with his past 4 years of depression.He has moved out of our bedroom as
he needs his own space and he gets up and down a lot in the night due to
nightmares and permanent nightshift worker at the mines.I feel I no
longer know how to be around him or even just chat with him, because it
seems he doesn't want anything to do with me. And I'm worried I will
upset him.He said he can't talk to me about how's he feeling, and I
think he knows that it might upset me.I have gone from phonecalls or
texts every day to absolutely nothing and don't know if I should be
contacting him just to check-in or what.The only time he seems to talk
to me is when he talks about going to Thailand next year for 2 months by
himself. As he thinks he needs to step out of his comfort zone and go
somewhere to be by himself where no-one knows him. I am just completely
lost and don't know where I am with him anymore. I keep reminding myself
it's not me it's what's going on in his head but it's hard not to take
things personally and I'm sick of getting upset all the time.xx

                    I was working full time enjoying life until workplace bullying led to
major depressive disorder and anxiety. I had tried to do some work but
the impact on my mental health was significant. After even a 1 hour
consult with a client, I’d be in bed, unable to face the world just
wanting to sleep sometimes for days. Keeping up my role as father and
husband has been severely affected. I’ve now ceased all work and this
did provide an improvement in my mental health but it was short lived. I
am now in a low mood, doing only the necessities of life and spending my
time in bed. I feel paralysed. I can’t seem to move forward. The only
thing I look forward to is bed time, and that is a challenge given my
struggles trying to sleep. On the nights I have a sleeping tablet it’s
great. The noise and self hatred stops until I wake up. I don’t know
what more to do.

                    Has anyone experienced this, or are you? Is there anything you’ve found
that’s actually helped, even if a little? I’ve always struggled a bit
with self esteem and avoiding things too. In high school I became very
depressed for the first time and lost all my interests, and never really
recovered. I’m 30 now and I feel like a shell of a person, like I don’t
have any strengths or ideas or value. I don’t really know who I am or
what I want. I don’t feel happy, I just scrape by everyday. At the same
time, I think I do have an idea of what I want or what I think I do but
I just maybe haven’t let myself stop and think about it let alone try
achieve it. Like having a partner and a family. I’ve never been in a
proper relationship, I would never let it progress to that. I’ve barely
dated anyone. Just as I’ve started to explore that more I’ve learned I
have premature menopause and I’m likely infertile. I’m finding it so
upsetting and triggering of these feelings, like of course I am I always
knew I’d be alone because I’m defective and unlovable. I know that’s not
logical but I can’t help but believe it and it keeps coming up. I feel
so sad and lonely, none of my friends or family understand. It was so
hard to even get my doctors to me seriously. And when I have opened up
to people they haven’t meant to but making comments like oh yeah my mum
takes that… someone 35 years older than me with three kids and
grandkids…

                    I need to get out of this relationship it's killing me, to the point
It's ruining me as a person and a mother, he won't accept my wishes and
puts the guilt trip on to me and things will change, no it won't I can
see that now, how to I leave without becoming a problem, can I get an

                    Hi all, I feel so alone and like I have no friends. When I was younger,
I had many friends and was quite social, but now it feels like no one
wants to hang out with me. I've tried many times to reach out and make
plans, but I get rejected every time. I never get invited anywhere. I
feel jealous when my husband gets invited to hang out with the boys or
go to the pub after work, while I'm stuck at home with the kids because
no one wants to hang out with me. I feel like there's no point in living
if I have no friends. The only reason I haven't done anything is because
of my kids. I constantly think about them and how they would have no mum
around anymore. I pretty much stay at home by myself with nothing to do
and no one to talk to. My husband works crazy hours and is hardly ever
home. My eldest is 14 and is never home, and my youngest is nearly 10,
so it won't be long until she's out most of the time too. I just feel so
alone and always think, ""What's the point in living?""

                    In earl 2000s I had a serious accident that almost killed me, I was
married and my wife was fantastic through this period of my life we got
through it and life’s rolled on with our two kids who are now grown up.
At age 61 in and late 2022 my mum passed away and in December of that
year I began to transition to retirement in Jan 2023 my wife said she
wanted to leave me. For me this was out of the blue and gutted me still
does. A few weeks after the announcement I found out she was cheating on
me since early 2022. It’s totally gutted me and made me feel ashamed and
worthless as a man and person for that matter. I haven’t been in contact
with her since this time and our financial settlement is completed . So
today I’m feeling low and I see an email from her requesting divorce
proceedings. This has hit me hard and I wounded if I will ever get over
it. I have had counciling and was told I still have PTSD from 2000s
accident and combined with the death of my mother, retirement and wife
leaving me was depressed. Anyway the councillor didn’t work out. In mid
2023 I returned to work and have engrossed myself in my work. I have no
external interest and work is my life and I’m good at what I do. Anyway
today I receive an email for divorce proceedings and it’s hit me hard
and I’m struggling to cope. At 63 I feel like I should be able to cope
and be big enough to move on like my ex but I just can’t seem to.

people would just say- oh theres no way your 14 you would never
understand how hard it can be well not exactly i get home from school
evry day and get constantly abused by my sister and if i ever layed a
hand or yelled or swore at her i would get the cops called on me btw my
sister is 16 and bigger then me but the only reason why she gets away

                    I'm 27 in 3 weeks. I'm still living in my parent's home with parents who
continue to control how I manage my money, won't let me drive on my own,
not even pay for a home/apartment. When I try to do chores (such as
washing clothes or fixing a light bulb), they criticise how I do it and
take over. When I was with my father at Coles, and I tried to pay, he
butted in and gave the cashier his card. She looked at me as if I was
spoiled. My mother is excessive to the point she has given away my
clothes, belongings and changed furniture. She's looked through my
wallet and once confiscated my card, because 'I spend way too much'.
She's criticised my 'sexy dress style' and told me to 'lose some
weight', hence why she's given them away. They've recently become
concerned that I'm still single and unmarried, and are pressuring me to
'give them grandchildren before they die'. While they pay for my taxes,
fees, and support me financially, they don't care about me emotionally.
When I've felt down and upset, they would mock and dismiss my problems,
telling me to just get over it'. They laughed at me when having dark
thoughts, saying it's nothing compared to 'them escaping war and having
family members pass away from war.' On the surface, people look down on
me, thinking I'm spoiled and entitled. But the truth is, I've felt so
trapped, misunderstood, embarrassed, and repressed. Ironically, it's
come to a point where I've splurged in luxury and self-care (aka,
makeup, body treatments, and Chanel). I love glamming up and hitting the
bars/clubs and socialising with people. Nothing is more thrilling than
people telling me I look 'hot' and having guys and girls flirt with me.
(My family doesn't know I'm bisexual, and they're anti-LGBT). I've
always felt so insecure about my actual life, my working-class
background, my controlling parents, and loathe my body image. I'm
embarrassed about my excessive spending and budgeting struggles. I feel
so embarrassed that while my friends are getting married and becoming
parents, I'm the one still being parented. I'm still the one who has to
be followed around, check on, and have barely a say in my own financial
and other decisions. Just because they paid for my school, taxes and
fled war does not mean that they care about me. All I just want is to be
truly loved, and trusted. Hugs and kisses mean far more to me, than a
house they will give to me after they pass. I'm just too conflicted
right now. Much appreciated.

                    I’ve been struggling with my life for the past 7-8 years but I finally
made an appointment with a doctor. I feel really scared though because I
don’t ever go to the doctor for anything, and I havent seen this doctor
for so many years that I’m really scared that they’ll judge me or won’t
believe anything I say. I’m really anti social so I feel like I won’t be
able to say what I wanna say or I’ll say the wrong thing causing them to
just dismiss me and move me along without helping. I’m just tired of
feeling alone, depressed and just worthless but I’m really scared to
talk to them.

                    Me and my finance have been together for 5 years. We share two beautiful
children of our own and I have a child from a previous relationship. I'm
lacking an emotional connection with my fiance. He's grown up in a
really difficult situation, this makes him block out his emotions
because that's what he learned to do to cope. I'm a highly emotional,
empathetic person. I like to talk about how I feel and this seems to be
overwhelming to him which ends in a fight and him walking away/blocking
me out. The thing that kills me the most is that he could easily walk
away from this relationship if he wanted to and I'd be an absolute
wreck. There's so many times I feel lonely, like I can't express myself
because I don't want it to end in a fight. I love this man so much and
when we are good we are really good. But I need more from him, I need
him to be more than surface level with me. I also resent him for
allowing me to be alone in my feelings, allowing me to sit there crying
while he just walks off to bed because he's had enough of the
conversation. I get people deal with things differently but he won't
even address the situation at a later date he just brushes it off. It
makes me feel unimportant and that my feelings aren't valid. it's
ruining me, I've booked in to see my gp tomorrow to hopefully get a
mental health plan but I feel like he needs to fix himself before this
relationship can ever be fixed.

                    I’ve been suffering with this issue more than a year now but
unfortunately still couldn’t find an answer. I just had 8 sessions with
my previous psychologist. During 5th or 6th session I started to
develope romantic/erotic thoughts towards my psychologist. It was really
distressing and disturbing to manage my day to day life. These thoughts
were unwanted and irrational. So I raised it with my psychologist and I
thought she would help me with cope with it. Unfortunately she
terminated therapy. Then I felt rejected and abandoned by the person I
mostly trusted and I couldn’t tolerate it. I started to follow her home
after work, stalking her on social media and invading her privacy. I
knew it inappropriate, I didn’t want to scare her, I didn’t want to give
her stress full time, I didn’t want to harass or abuse her, I didn’t
mean anything but I couldn’t control my impulsive thoughts. In the end
she went to the court and applied an IVO against me. It was so shameful
for me so I didn’t want to go to court. I have had past attempts on my
life. After this episode I got pregnant with a baby boy . Unfortunately,
I could complete only 16 weeks. I had a miscarriage. It was
unbelievable, my baby was completely normal had a strong heart beat.
However, I had to give a birth to a dead baby. I am depressed again and
have thoughts towards my previous psychologist. I have urged to go and
see her but my hands are tight by the court order. The buildup pressure
drives me to suicidal thoughts again. I want to stop these cycles
happening again. I’m taking my medication but nothing helps. My
psychiatric discharged me to my GP during the suicidal episode. since
then no other psychiatrist accepts my referral. I haven’t seen a
psychiatrist for 6 months. I asked help from so-called mental health
professionals. No one helps me. I don’t know who to call, when I call
PTS, a nurse told me i’m too far from their hospital. I can’t go to my
nearest hospital as my husband works as a mental health nurse in there.
I had enough, I am so tired , but I have to live for my 3 year old
daughter. I want to know what’s wrong with me. My previous psychiatrist
diagnosed BPD last year. Can someone please help me and tell me what to
do and how to stop these cycle of episodes.

                    Growing up I didn't like my father because he wasn't ideal. He wasn't
involved, encouraging, praising and socially valuable, affectionate,
understanding and supportive. He never cared about me achieving my
driving, figuring out a life purpose and generally transitioning into a
adult. He was selfish, grandiose, and would talk behind your back and
think lies are nothing, if you don't know their being told. I also hate
his sister I had to know his friend for a little longer than a dozen
years when I was going through high school. I was bullied all during
high school and suffering everyday for six years since 2008 until 2013.
I hated everyone in the school. I had five extra years of bad
mistreating acquaintance toxic relationship's and that lasted until
2018. I haven't agreed with my mental health diagnosis that I had since
2012 - 2014 which was a result because of my mistakes. The
pharmaceuticals I've been involuntary enforced on are detrimental and I
had three years of weight gain, than it lead to some stretch marks and I
was compensating and hating against tablet nausea with the old meds. It
got even worse being diagnosed with pre diabetes in 2017 and than by
2020 I was having the cholecystectomy with my gallbladder being removed.
It's the most un luck that anyone would get, it's literally being
murdered with their treating, yet I'm obviously given no compensation,
no apologies, no voluntary rights since their a promised myth. I've been
destroyed. To make it worse I have this horrible reality of
spirituality, I CAN'T detach, it's connected to the shrinks I was forced
to see back in 2021 when I was demanded into having a admission into
hospital, despite telling them I was fine and not wanting to go, my
general practioner insisted and argued he felt concerned. I just am
constantly discriminated about my intelligence in numerous ways
internally and made to feel different in negative ways. I can't prove it
to anyone, I just know that it's mixed from the American's and my brief
hospital visit, I didn't like the psychologist and the psychiatrist I
had to experience during those four weeks. They invalidated me and were
cold, looking through me as a idiot and spoke to me like I was a child.
I told the doctor I didn't agree with my diagnosis. He extended my time
for two weeks and than I was on a 9 month community order to get a
monthly injection. They see me as a relapse and I was only a voluntary
forced admission, I didn't want to go. They generalise me too.

                    I recently have gotten much better mentally thanks to my psychologist,
my Auntie R and a person who talked to me once on YouTube. For a long
time I suffered from narcissism because for example, I use to want to be
the prettiest and most popular girl in school which I never was and now
realize that it doesn't matter. I also really wanted to have a daughter
one day and don't get me wrong because even when I was narcissistic, I
knew I would care about her needs and would love her no matter what
(children are so lovely and it would be extremely hard not to love your
own child especially), but one of the reasons why I wanted a daughter
back then was quite frankly (I feel really bad saying this) to live
through her. I was hoping that she would be the ""prettiest"" and most
popular girl in school because I never was and I was also hoping that
she would be an extremely nice person because even then, I knew I wasn't
that nice (I tried really hard to be nice because it makes people feel
good and because I want to be a really nice person or at least a nice
person but I wasn't very good at it most of the time), but that wouldn't
be fair for my daughter and it wouldn't be fair to my son if I had one
as well for that matter. I also found it extremely hard to listen to
people, to take accountability, etc. People also say that I am lying
about not remembering things that I have said and done, but I genuinely
don't remember a lot of the mean things I have said about people. I have
asked them to please talk to me about it in a *direct* way so I know
what I said, but they only either talk to me about it in an indirect way
or they would talk to people pretending to be me online about it (a lot
of people have pretended to be me online) and there for it doesn't get
through to me. The people I have mentioned earlier helped me get over my
narcissism because they reminded me that even when I was unwell that I
do have some things that are really good about me (everyone has things
that are really good them) and they very politely encouraged me to work
on my weaknesses as well as remembering that I have a lot of strengths
as well. The person on Youtube told me about shadow work and about how
we all have things that are good and bad about us and that even if you
have this disorder, you still have good things about you and you can
always work on the bad things about you. (He said it in a really nice
way too). I would just like some more *kind* advice to help me improve
more and more........

                    Chronic Pain ManagementHi there, how are you all doing? I have a
question that I suffer from chronic pain. In my entire body, specially
in feet, heels, knees, lower back, as I am a amputee. I have a problem
in my right hand too, doctors suspect carpal tunnel. As long as I don't
do anything, it's okay. But if I do something, it's painful. For which I
was on pain medication. So as I have a addiction too, is doing a opioid
replacement therapy. And did nothing for pain management, as I am
thinking about stopping opioid replacement therapy. I will have to deal
with pain. Which was somehow numbed because of the medication I use for
addiction. On top of that I have a mental illness too, if I speak to a
doctor. What they say is, reasonable help. They can give me, so it's
really a struggle. How you can recover if you are in agony from pain.
Doctor gives you nothing for pain. And the antibiotics you use gives you
a tremors and extrapyramidal side effects. The support network you have,
has a different agenda. Which they are kept on hiding and kept on
pursuing there motives. How to deal with all that

                    20 years into life feels like I have lived 20 decades. I am constantly
stressed out due to living in a noisy, unsafe neighborhood, i was
verbally assaulted by them too last year. No matter how much I seek help
from strata, council, and other neighbors, nothing has helped. Literally
nothing quietens the bloody people that live around me. I despise
staying home, my parents and I do not have a good relationship and being
around them worsens my mental health. I spend my days just being out and
coming back to sleep at home at 10 pm. I have applied for housing and
submitted all my documents, but my case manager has not reached out to
me in a long time now. Despite being newly employed, I barely get shifts
and as I am someone who wants to move out thru rent choice youth, it is
so much more complex. I lost my job in december, 2023 and I just got a
job this month, and the lack of shifts make me feel useless and
unemployed. Things just have been so slow, crappy, and bad for me.
Stress is getting me to the point that I have chronic headaches and
nosebleeds, and my GP asked me to do a MRI. All i want is just a good,
consistent job that does not affect my uni timetable and helps me save
some money to escape my noisy, abusive household. I used to be highly
religious and since stuff has been severely low for me, I am literally
agnostic. I just feel so hopeless and lost on life.

                    I've had a tough few years and think I have trauma that keeps coming up
for me from what ive been through. As a quick summary without writing a
huge essay the below traumas I'm trying to deal with: PTSD & PND from
first born son (2016)2nd baby was diagnosed with down syndrome and 25%
survival so I had a medical termination as 13 weeksBrain tumor (size of
a golf ball) in 2020 and rushed into brain surgery, tumor was not
cancerous but have regular checkups17 year marriage, cohesion control
(2022) managed to claw my way out of the marriage to leaveNo family
support in Australia all family in UK Mother in law and I got into an
argument over her filming me whilst on a kids pickup, and I ended up
being arrested for intimidation and went to court. (Never been in
trouble with the police before) I was totally distraught by how the
police treated me as the perpetrator. Suicidal and ended up in
emergencyMy best friend suddenly died at 39 years old in 2023The same
day I went to court I fell over afterwards and broke my ankle in 2
places and dislocated it, and had surgerySon was diagnosed with ADHD and
mild intellectual disability in 2023I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2023
How do you deal with it all, most psychologist in my opinion are not
good, mainly young and have no idea. feeling helpless and hopeless even
though my everyday life is not bad at all, actually better than its been
for years but these trauma's change you as a person.

about my career and what I want to do for the rest of my life and I

                    Hello, This is my first post on this platform- I am not used to reaching
out and talking about issues. I've always been the type to deal with it
by myself, mostly by distractions or suppressing it until it either goes
away or comes out in a big gush. In April I ruptured my ACL playing
soccer- something I have played for the better part of 15 years. I am in
an U20s squad, and was beginning to get senior games and recognition
when it happened doing something I've done millions of times before-
changing direction. I still dream about it and get flashbacks. 3 weeks
ago I had my ACL reconstruction. After the pain I experienced in the
first week - I thought that would be the worst of it, but the mental
side of it has hit me like a truck- especially at nights. It feels like
a part of my identity is gone, and I'm struggling to see the light at
the end of this 12 month tunnel back to soccer. I have nowhere to
express my emotion or escape reality and am stuck in a cycle of avoid
and ignore until night time where I inevitably break down. I have so
much support, I just don't want to burden them with the same rubbish. I
know I can't change it, and it's not worth dwelling over but I can't
help it. I keep asking ""why me?"". I was hoping for someone who
understands this mental toll- and who could maybe help me. I've been
told 'it gets better' and 'you'll come back stronger', but it all sounds
like words so early into this struggle. If anyone can share insight into
their experience, or give strategies to keep myself positive I would be
so grateful. Thank you.

                    Looking for advice for dealing with a 16yo boy who has been giving the
silent treatment for 3 days now. He is isolating from school, friends
and sport and not talking at all.I feel like we’ve tried all avenues but
he’s giving nothing. At what point do we reach for help and how do we do
that?For context he has experienced anxiety and bullying in the past,
possibly still ongoing off and on and we have been seeking assistance

                    I live with my mum. I'm 47, she's 77. She's a widow and I'm on a DSP for
reasons that I won't go into. She's incredibly depressed after losing
her husband (dad) over 8 years ago. I have terrible days too. There are
days where she bottles up her emotions and then explodes like a volcano.
It usually takes half hour of arguing to peel back the layers to
discover the reason. Sometimes it's her reluctance to accept ageing.
Often it's her loneliness, especially considering we never see my
brother's family (3 grandkids and wife who no longer talks to us). She
has a heart of gold and wants to save the world, but can't help herself
with her own depression. We even had Legacy ring the other day and she
brushed them off. She's lonely, sits at home all day and reads books,
but never wants to go out. How do others cope? I have offered to take
her to libraries, to cafes, to lunch, etc. Nothing. She frets about
going to the hairdresser. We're both still grieving the loss of my dad,
but our depression seems to feed each other. I have a woodworking hobby
and that gets me out of the mindset, but is it even possible to help
loved ones like this? I often don't realise how depressed I am in this
environment until I go out and talk to someone my own age. How do other
""carers"" cope with watching someone deteriorate so much, given that she
used to be so happy?

                    Hi everyone and thankyou in advance for reading my post.For the past 2
years I have been battling severe depression. I feel completely numb. I
have isolated myself from pretty much every relationship I had, except
for my boyfriend who has been extremely supportive.I feel only negative
emotions, and cannot remember the last time I’ve been happy or
excited.However I have a great life. I have a loving stable family, a
stable job I enjoy, I love my boyfriend of 5 years, a decent amount of
savings, I’m in great health and have a trip to New York booked for
Christmas with my partner. I can appreciate all these things in my life,
however I am still depressed. In turn, I feel guilty for my depression.
I am 28 years old and my partner and I have been struggling with having
our first home built. It has taken 3 years so far and is only half way
built. The process has completely drained me, as I feel like my life
isn’t moving forward because of it.we both still live at home with our
parents, and I am absolutely miserable about it. And I feel guilty about
that too because my parents have helped me.I definitely feel like this
is the reason I’m feeling this way, however I also feel guilty and
ungrateful for my life. i am so confused, and in my spare time I just
lay in my bed and cry. not sure what I’m looking for here, but I come
from a family who doesn’t share their feelings.i have grown up being the
“overly sensitive” one, and whenever I voice my feelings about anything,
I am shut down and told that I am causing too much drama. thank you for

                    I'm looking for some help supporting my extremely depressed brother. He
is 25 years old and has struggled with his mental health his whole life.
He lives at home with our mother and myself, and he finds it difficult
to do normal things everyday. Examples of this include being out all
night and sleeping all day, starting fights over very small things (he
yelled at me for having a light on during the day), has no interest and
does not participate in work or study, doesnt shower and doesnt eat. He
has been like this for approx 18 months. He wont accept help from family
or friends and wont agree to take medication or seek professional help.
This is effecting our family as it is currently the responsibility of me
and my mum to support him however we can, but it is extremely draining
for us emotionally. I'm looking for anyone who can offer advice, support
or suggest someone who I can reach out to as I genuinely dont know what
else I can do to help him. Thank you!

replied to some peopleI think that two champions replied to my first two
postsI do not know where they are now I have supported several posts of
othersI have replied to one person I think today I am resonating with
several posts in different areas but cannot remember where they are I am
literally lost within this website as well as within myself I am working
very hard at keeping the dreaded ""D"" at bay which I have battled with
too many times.I have had this since young apparentlyI have had large
gaps of time where I am mostly symptom free I think The monster is the
dreaded ""d""It is also a relative whom I have had to relinquish her hold
over me.I have only learnt about this stuff recently so struggle talking
about it. So I think of do not feed the monster as in do not think of
her. Or do not feel guilty or upset or worry or a thousand other things
Also do not feed the dreaded ""d"" as it lurks waiting I will not find

                    Hi, I just wanted to rant about how I’ve been feeling & hopefully gain
some advice or make others feel less alone. I’m in my senior year of
high school atm and have been living alone for two years now. I achieve
good marks but find I regularly lose motivation for study because of my
depression, eating disorder and often feel confused about my future. My
most common feeling is loneliness. I have no friends at school or in my
personal life so when I come home from school, I am alone & cope with
these feelings through severe binge eating. This has become a daily
routine of coming home and eating until I physically feel uncomfortable.
Because of this, I have gained a bit of weight and struggle with body
dysmorphia. It’s very hard to go out when I feel I don’t look my best
because I place a lot of my worth of the way I look. I feel whenever
people are looking at me, they are judging me, which causes me to
isolate myself from the world. This usually results in major depressive
episodes consisting of self harm and suicidal thoughts. I find when I
feel sad, it’s an excruciating pain throughout my body and I become very
desperate to get rid of these feelings (hence the binging). I am seeking
professional help and about to start anti depressants for the first time
in a couple years, I really hope they help. Thanks for listening:)

                    I have been battling PTSD, depression and anxiety since 2007. Lately I
have been getting angry at the smallest things. I'm constantly upsetting
my missus. I'm seeing a psychologist but lately I have been missing
sessions and telling my missus it's because of overtime, but it's really
because I can't get motivated to go. I have no friends and hate social
situations. I am starting to struggle to remember things. I'm also
struggling to understand things I'm told and things I read. I'm
struggling to spell words properly now. I hate being like this.

                    I’ve been struggling with my life for the past 7-8 years but I finally
made an appointment with a doctor. I feel really scared though because I
don’t ever go to the doctor for anything, and I havent seen this doctor
for so many years that I’m really scared that they’ll judge me or won’t
believe anything I say. I’m really anti social so I feel like I won’t be
able to say what I wanna say or I’ll say the wrong thing causing them to
just dismiss me and move me along without helping. I’m just tired of
feeling alone, depressed and just worthless but I’m really scared to
talk to them.

                    Hi, I’m an autistic teen, and I feel like all my friends are leaving me,
judging me, and just being overall toxic. I recently was called a bad
human by one of them, and it feels like my only friends are ones at my
old school. I am pretty depressed and I don’t feel that happy lately…

                    I just use the sentences in the daily life is all right? To introduce
myself, I am a student which came from an international school that
studied easy knowledges in China. When Melbourne Uni gave me this offer,
I was very pleasant and feeling very anticipate to this school's life.
But the life changed in the study period in Australia. An unlucky and
unexperienced thing that I met was I were struggled with the scam.
During this time, I was trapped and controlled by Chinese which was the
same country and I doubted myself very much after this thing. It was
like a terrible crack down for me and several weeks later was the final
week and I did nothing in the scam in this seven week and I cried a lot.
It was the most awful experience that I met in Melbourne but this thing
can be blamed just of myself. So I failed lots of subjects and I don't
adapt the life in Australia neither.Then after this bad thing happen, I
decided to study in Summer term that rely on myself and I nearly have
nobody to talk about my life so I feel isolated from others a bit of
time, just the originally friends and parents. But this was a small
thing to me .The time right now that I wrote is I just found my interest
in subject not in my high school so doing some subjects that I dislike
is a very suffered thing to me. So when I studied the building class
which introduces lots of information in construction industry not the
mathematics one, I feel anxiety and cannot pay attention in it. The most
depression feeling is I found myself cannot do a successful subject
throughout my hardworking. The only thing that I can do right now is to
wait for my failing another subjects in the second or third semester and
I can do nothing with it. I feel very nervous about the study and I want
to get a good grade but I cannot do this so it is like I feel I am very
depress right know when I am typing this words.

                    Around 6 months ago I wrote here in a very, very distressed state. I had
no real support otherwise in real time. Its hard to write about myself
as i have alot of shame and almost non- existent self esteem esp atm. Im
41, female who has never really left home and had traumas at a young
adult age with little support other than home alone with my animals and
the very nice environment we were living in. 5 acres around farmland
just outside our costal tourist town.I had my big chicken house that
looked like a giant cubby. I had the pleasure of having ducks, a turkey,
chickens and lots of roosters, two sheep, and more. On complete rain
water and out away from pollution in the fresh air, quiet away from any
cars, very secluded and with a very nice view. Id lived there with my
parents for 26 years, since i was 14. I have social phobia/ GAD and
complex parents -mum with hearing disabilities and who can be very
dominant and quiet and dictating at times. Ive always tried to help
myself and at times been on a roll, but i’ve always had my environment
to be my calm go-to, part of my spirituality and support for myself, my
foundation, my calmness and basically a romance with the place. Nearly 6
months ago, dad declared we were moving asap because he wanted to invest
money for my sister to get a house. It was a complete shock and
distress. It was out of the blue with no warning and with no emotional
care at all. 2-3 months asap in dead winter to find a house to buy and
live by selling my everything place. It was irrational and made a
prolonged distress for me having to be yelled at for being upset and
having to be just me and dad moving everything. I told him i was feeling
suicidal and he threw stuff at my face. It was stressful times but I was
incredibly mentally unwell in a very bad way, continuing to push myself
for everyone with no support. By the time we moved and i had my own time
to myself, I severely broke down. I couldnt sleep, I was in severe shock
and emotional distress and on my iwn with it, my mum didnt want to know.
I had to ring the hospital for some support at some point.My days for
months was pushing myself if i had to drive my parents anywhere and
taking my dog for a walk, and then in bed so distraught and crying in so
much emotional pain it hurt so much. Its now nearly 6 months later and
ive come a long way from where i was emotionally, ive settled in more. I
see a psychologist and counselling. I push myself everyday.I get
creative with clay and gardening. Try to improve the house. But at the
end of the day, im still so upset i dont have my sanctuary, half my
animals, were in a built up urban area, i hate the backyard and the dark
house,I feel so hopeless- the things i loved are all gone, and altho i
practice radical acceptance and try to improve things- i still hate it.
I love country valleys, fresh air, gumtrees bushland, away from urban, i
love a sunny north facing house and farm animals. I wash myself with a
bucket of rainwater boiled rather than use the horrible tap water that
gives me rashes, i go outside for a drive and walk the dog to be in the
sun, i plant a garden to try and improve the backyard which is slabs of
concrete and a hills hoist. But at least there room for my chooks. What
weve gone from to here because of dads irrational choices is hard to
swallow. Our lifestyle has changed. My health has gone downhill mentally
and physically. I know in my bones what i need and want in life. My
sanctuary was my everything. Now when i go out, im severely depressed
and severely lacking in self esteem and have somewhat self neglect. And
esp at home. Its an added depression ontop of the depression i had b4
the move. I feel like ive lost my compass, ive lost my value and who i
am since weve moved and i feel hopeless in ever being able to get what i
want in life which is a sanctuary of my own. I feel heartbroken and not
home here. I hate living urban so much, but i push myself everyday, but
i know its just not me.

                    It's a complicated scenario but I've been wrongly diagnosed with
schizophrenia and I've been stuck under psychiatry for the last twelve
years. I have to have consultations every six months that I don't want
to have. I have to constantly get scripts and go every month to the
chemist and buy un wanted medication. I have to have medical
certificates and possibly occupational assessments just to legally drive
a vehicle too because of it, when I'm sane anyway. After over coming
weight gain, I then have had lasting un wanted belly stretch marks. To
make it worse I then was diagnosed with pre diabetes and three years
after that I was made to have a cholecystectomy. I'm constantly fighting
with any therapist and doctor because their telling me that I'm indenyl
and that I lack insight and that their experts and I know their wrong.
It's abusive when I know I am the injustice and the victim. I also have
so many experiences where I know it's a combination of North American's
or doctors/ therapist's and their laughing about my malpractice scenario
and misdiagnosis that they are trying to make me feel different, less
intelligent or wither I'm more on the autistic spectrum. It's
furthermore abuse. I even had one GP write caution on my patient paper
when given to another GP. All my life before and even still now I've
disliked my father. But I've always obviously been financially dependent
on him. He tells me wither I'm disabled, soft, inept, weak, pale, wither
I should be driving, wither I want to work or wither I can cook anything
without burning the house down. I not only had been socially, verbally
and physically bullied and degraded all during high school and hated
everyone in my school. I made the mistake of knowing two of them until I
was 23, when I was more wanting friends because I was in a younger
personality back then. Since high school it's been 11 years and I've
only had 9 month's of volunteer because I've had no direction for which
jobs I would want to do. There's no certificates I want to do and I
can't achieve anything from University. I won't work a apprenticeship or
a traineeship or anything with construction. I was told by one of their
mothers at 19 that I was a loser. I don't want to work entry sales,
hospitality, factory or even retail most likely. There's no route to
direct my life in now.

                    I'm worried about my future because I'm going to be 30 this year and I'm
still having trouble getting a job. For the time being I'm fine because
my parents are letting me live with them and they will also be helping
to get an apartment or house, but we don't know which one would be
better. I feel like it would make more sense for me to live in an
apartment since I will be living by myself and it would be cheaper, but
my parents are worried that there might end up being some scary people
in whichever apartment I move into (I'm very shy and naive for my age).
I know you can visit an apartment you're thinking of getting, but that
doesn't garuntee that there won't end up being scary people there. I
said to him that I will probably have to eventually move into an
apartment one day anyway and he just said ""mmm."" (I think he knows I'm
screwed either way). My older sister told me that when our parents are
no longer here that she would be able to help me out with money which is
very kind of her and she also said that I could live with them which is
also very kind of her, but to say that we don't get along when we live
together is a HUGE understatement. When we lived at home together (the
parent's houses) we had at least one HUGE fight every. single. day and
that's if it was an okay day. We literally fought so much, it was crazy!
It's got to be better than being homeless though. I'm hoping I will be
able to get a job soon with help from disability. If I can do that and I
one day soonish move into a house and I get a partner, we might be able
to share the bills one day if we live together. Also, do guys find it a
turn off if their lady doesn't have a job? I wouldn't mind being a
housekeeper if my bf was okay with that just as long as he picked up
after himself and didn't order me around. I would enjoy keeping the
house clean and tidy. I moved into a group house last year and for
several months I was living by myself and the real estate agent said she
was very impressed with how I was looking after the house and so did a
lot of other people and I enjoyed keeping the house tidy. I'm assuming
most men would want us to have a job as well though? Also, I still need
to learn how to cook (other than just really simple things like fish,
eggs and pasta).

                    Hi, I am a long term sufferer of mental illness. My current job is high
pressure and I am suffering more and more as time goes on. I have taken
a lot of leave and am now feeling like it is harder for me to continue
on with work. I would like to make a claim on my income protection but
am scared about the process. Is there anyone who has made a successful
claim for Temporary Disability or permanent disability? Any advice would
be greatly appreciated.

                    Greetings to fellow anonymous web-dwellers,I am a 35-y.o. who has
suffered from Social Anxiety, Depression, and OCD since adolescence. I
lost all my friends around 20 due to shame, embarrassment and stigma, as
I withdrew from the world. I thought that they would be better off
without me - I didn't want to be a burden. However, looking back my
friends were never very supportive, nor very emotionally dependable - it
was never the deep and meaningful friendship I have yearned for all my
life.Years of fruitless therapy later, I dropped out of my final
semester of university, even though my marks were excellent, due to
overwhelming anxiety and depression. I was brave, and I tried my best to
make friends, but my university experience was lonely and alienating.
Again, I withdrew from society. I soothed myself by watching television
compulsively - the vicarious illusion of company which helped the empty
years drift by. Isolated, my heart became numb, insensate to either
profound depths or exalted highs - I suffered, I was alone, but I did
not feel the intense pain, the pain that is so excruciating one thinks
only sleep or death can offer relief, that afflicts me now. I have not
had a single friend since I was 20, loneliness being my constant and
ever-present companion.However, in very awkward and unfortunate
circumstances, I recently met someone who I thought became my friend - a
true friend. I proceeded very slowly at first, and with caution, ever
having to overcome my anxiety to speak with her little by little. We
didn't see eachother very often at first. Later, unique circumstances
caused us to spend a lot of time together, talking and getting to know
eachother. Early on, she cried in front of me, and I attempted to
console her. Of course, I hid my mental illness from her - I wore my
dissembling mask. It seemed we were kindred spirits with a lot
surprisingly in common: both interests and personality traits - both
perfectionists and people-pleasers - with similar struggles and
adversities. We had both suffered in life. However, she was not at all
shy - just an anxious person. If ever I found a perfect friend, it was
her. One day she confided in me a very deep, and sad trauma which she
still continues to struggle with - resulting in suicidal ideation and
profound sorrow. At that moment I began to love and care for her deeply.
We grew closer and closer, and I tried to help her with her struggles as
best I could, and with my experience. I was often rebuffed for trying to
help her - she placed boundaries which I respected.As we grew close, I
began to feel the pain and sorrow I described above. The thought of
never seeing her again tore at my soul. I couldn't imagine life without
her in it. I summoned the courage and asked her cautiously, 'Are we
friends?' 'Yes, of course', she replied. Prior to that I often asked her
whether she actually liked me, out of insecurity. She affirmed she did.
The pain throbbed in my chest - it was unbearable. I decided to disclose
to her my sad story, and emphasised that after hearing it she was not
obliged to remain my friend. 'I am your friend', she replied, 'We are
friends'. A week passed, and the reason for I cannot say, but she
betrayed me. She renounced our friendship, and my world reeled. I was
angry and upset at her deception - her callous cruelty. I could no
longer bear to see her; we have parted, and we will never see eachother
again.I am in a world of hurt. I cannot stop my tears from flowing. Life
is empty and meaningless without her. The thought that I will never hear
her voice again, see her face, her smile, her bright eyes is unbearable.
I do not know how to cope; everything reminds me of her. I loved her as
a friend with all my heart, but as best as I can I cannot remove the
memory of her from my mind - dislodge the place I made for her in my
heart. I don't know how to deal with the heart-wracking pain of her
loss. I am in despair; I am all alone, again!Sincere gratitude to anyone
who reads this - apologies for the literary quality (I studied
literature at uni!).Yours sincerely.

                    Has anyone gone through a situation where you were attacked by the
entire society literally? I am trying to convince myself that I am
having delusions but it's more than a dream at the moment considering
what's going on. I think I am so famous in the entire country I live in
and even think I am involved in a grand conspiracy. Yes this might be
delusion but the moment people see me they attack, period. Passive
attack to make me mentally sick. I feel like a celebrity, I am kind of
enjoying little bit of it every now and then. Playing with attackers is
my new hobby and something that keeps me moving to be honest. Gotta give
them credit for that eventhough they don't realize it. But what in the
world have I done to end up like this?

                    Hi everyone, I wanted to reach out Into this forum in the hope of
meeting other people that might have been through similar to me or who
might actually understand what I’ve been through. I was bullied at
school (a girls school) which led to anxiety and depression from my
teens where I would dread going to school and feel like I didn’t want to
live. I had a group of friends that would witness my bullying and would
never stand up for me they would always say they wanted to be friends
with the people who I felt like tortured me on a daily basis. I then
left school and had a partner cheat on me and those same friends told me
they all wanted to stay friends with him. That group of friends began to
shut me out invite me to parties and not speak to me. Also a video was
posted on Facebook of them calling me horrible names. Then at my second
year of university one main girl created a Facebook group stating how
she wanted us all to be friends and move forward and as soon as I
replied they all blanked me! I became really depressed but didn’t
realise I was depressed, drinking a lot until I blacked out but just
acting as if it was normal because I was young and it was what everyone
does. I then moved away to university and I suffered at the hands of
girls again, dismissing me or being horrible for no apparent reason and
I continued in my depression. During my second year at university those
friends that I went travelling and began to move forward also with
recent help from a counsellor. Then I met my current partner but he was
fully attached to the same group of friends from school that were never
there for me more so the boys. Last year two of my partners friends were
getting married in which I felt like I had no choice to go to the
weddings with him. My partner didn’t take seriously what I have
previously been through and I felt like I had no choice. The girl that
made the Facebook group whilst at uni was going to be there. The fear in
me was real I felt like attending those weddings was causing me PTSD. I
was travelling before both and I spent a lot of the time talking about
the weddings in which I now realise was complete fear that I was not
able to understand or explain. The final wedding was horrific, that girl
had basically created a gang of grown adult women against me and I felt
completely traumatised leaving on my own. This second experience of
bullying as an adult has completely broken me. Has anyone had similar or
can understand or relate to my experience?

my purpose? and i feel like i cant be sad becuase i have so many things
to be greatful for, but deep down i'm not happy. its so hard to explain
this feeling like its not numbness but im not happy. i think its the
mood swings from being happy when im with friends then sad and upset
when im in my room and alone.I dont want to ask my bestfriend for help
becuase i know her life was so much tougher than mine and i dont want
anyone feeling bad for me and saying sorry. my sister was diagnosed with
depresssion ages ago and now is fine, so i feel like i cant ask for help
becuase i dont want to end up like how my sister was.i get these random
episodes of dissassociation quite frequently and when i snap out of it i
feel so fake, its like gettting deja vu, it freaks me out and really
makes me think like wtf just happened and then i get this wave of
dissassosiation and it repeats. a never ending cycle.i just want to be
happy and 'normal'

                    I moved to Australia from the UK a year ago with my partner of 4 years.
Before coming out here I was on the fence about the relationship. Now I
find myself questioning it daily, I am suffering from depression big
time and most of my days are filled with the dread of where my life has
gone wrong. I was dissatisfied by life in London and my career was
uninteresting to me. Yet I find myself in Brisbane, living a copy and
paste existence; and now after being unemployed for several months, I am
considering going back into my old career. I want to work and build back
my savings, but I don’t know if staying here and staying in this
relationship is healthy for me? I want to explore more of Australia as I
have been so depressed I have missed opportunities to see the country,
but I don’t think this move hasn't been the change of lifestyle that I
wanted. like I said earlier, being here is the same as in London in my
mind. I still don't get to see the outdoors much, the daily routine is
the same and I'm not interested just going to bars and cafes, and
walking around city parks. Three months ago I signed a lease with my
partner for 12 months, I felt a bit pressured into it. Since then I have
been unsettled by the commitment. I am filled with total anxiety over
the whole thing. I miss my friends and family; I feel stuck in the
relationship, and I no longer find joy in the things I used to enjoy at
all. I want to get better, but I find myself sucked down by negativity
that I am just following the wrong path, one that is not my own. I also
feel that I spend so much time stressed out by the relationship and
having to find work that I can't work on getting better. On top of this
it bears heavily on my mind that I will have to stay at this potential
job for at least a year as the past two years I have travelled and done
brief stints of work here or there. As a 30yo man I feel like life is
changing and my career is a train wreck and I am just now leading myself
down the path which I think is wrong, but is what I beleive others to
see as being right.I have no idea what to do, I want control back in my
life.

                    I am a single mum to two teens. My youngest has struggled with School
Can’t for the last few years, is very likely Autistic and we are going
through the very slow process of diagnosis. I have had to homeschool
her, while also working, for the last two years. My girls’ dad calls
them every few weeks and sees them maybe once every couple of months.
Financial assistance from him just doesn’t happen so I do my best to
make sure they have what they need. These days there is just so little
to spare so it’s been a very long time since we had any kind of break
from the constant drone. I have had Hashimoto’s disease for about 6
years now. It’s exhausting, and most of the time I have pain. Exercising
hurts, even gentle walking, though I used to walk every day. Common
foods cause flare ups but I’m so tired most of the time that I just
don’t have the energy to do better planning. By the time I get home each
day I have to push myself through all the things that need doing but I
feel like I’m letting my girls down so much. Every day is just putting
on a happy face for the world and my kids and reminding myself that we
have food and a roof over our heads and we are safe. I don’t have family
support and I’ve really struggled to connect with therapists. I really
just don’t know how long I can keep going and keep up the front. The
future is looking even harder than the present. Keeping on going was
really all I had to rely on but my health is just getting worse and the
only thing that keeps me pushing on is my girls. I don’t want to let
them down. I don’t want them to be hurting.

                    Don’t know where to start Hi people, i am 34 yo male living in Australia
i came to study my Masters after completing bachelors overseas and i did
one year job after my bachelors in IT and my father asked me to apply
for australia as it is good country etc so i did and its been 9 years i
struggled alot and after Masters or even during my studies i was
introduced to gamnling world by my friend who insists to go to casino
several times and somehow i hooked to it and not blaming anyone i was
weak minded and used to spend all my hard earned money on gambling
whether it was to recover the losses and 3-4 years went by and then
obviously i lost my mind in that time and couldn’t focus on really
really important stuff then i think went to depression and bit of
homosexuality too out of self hate. Finally got married as i always was
straight acting but never had any gf due to culture norms overseas. Due
to my bad financial planning and stuff wife left me and compared me with
my other friends who are so called settled now have office jobs and its
been few months i can’t cope up with it and still working like 7 days
but don’t know where i am heading and no plans and age is passing by
idea of working like this in casual jobs for more years kills me. Most
hurting part is i am heartbroken due to divorce. How to pit my life
together anyone in the same situation i have never seen a doctor but
think i need help coz of headache and feeling lazy all the time. Cheers

                    I only have 4 months of school left and i have quite a big friendship
group at school which would be amazing right?... wrong! the thing i can
admit is that ill always be alone. I've never had a close friend that's
NOT been one-sided, because i know I'm not theirs and i hate using the
term ""bff"" its so cliche, but its so humbling when you say ""your my best
friend"" and they wont say it back. this is so aimed at one person but
like idgaf this person will forever choose their ""popular friends"" over
me and that truly breaks my heart.is it the way i look? the way i speak?
like why cant i get equally returned love???I just want someone to love
me. its always me starting convos or organizing plans with them, like if
i stopped talking to them overall, they would even ask if i was okay.
they would just let us drift.i cant friendship break up with them, its
not an option and i cant talk to them about it so it just feels like I'm
digging myself a whole that goes deeper and deeper and deeper i know ill
always get chosen last and that really makes me upset. i wish being a
human was easy.After school i know ill barely have anyone left, so what
does it feel like to be totally alone?

                    Thankfully I have savings, but now I had to see my GP who said I have to
go back to my psychiatrist to talk about meds AND see my psychologist
weekly. I was losing it before and I dunno, I just can't care anymore
about my savings, just waiting for them to be completely depleted as I
""get healthy"" again. For years I have been fine on medication but now as
the world is getting so expensive, me having no career or having to work
so much instead of enjoying life is draining me... I saw my psychologist
on Wednesday and now just tempted to say I want to see how new meds on
top of my old ones are going to affect me before seeing her again since
it's all so expensive! In the end I know my partner would be fine with
supporting me, but what if I didn't have him? I would never be able to
cope with all of this and the cost too! I

                    Hello everybody, I am 18 in less than 2 months, and that is the age I am
able to go to the doctors without my parents and get medication
prescribed to me I wont get too deep into my mental illnesses, but I'm
pretty positive I have depression and some other things wrong with me.
Both my parents have depression and both my siblings have it so I think
its very likely I have it. We also have family history of Autism, OCD,
and anxiety. But I don't really feel comfortable walking into my GP's
office or going to a psychologist/therapist for now. I can't afford
therapy and all I really want is antidepressants. I'm certain I need
antidepressants because it's affecting my life and my relationship
pretty badly. I'm alright with living with depression since I feel i've
been depressed since childhood, but I don't want to negatively
affect/worry my bf (and my friends become assholes and take it
personally when I isolate due to depression, so I dont wanna deal with
that drama) I've gotten acne prescriptions from telehealth services
before, and I was just wondering if you could ring up a telehealth
service, have a quick appointment, and simply get an antidepressant
prescription from a GP? If so, what are good services for this?Thank you

                    So I guess this weekend is one of the worst weekends I’ve felt for a
long time. I’ve just been lying here on my couch alone, in the dark,
crying, listening to music… I just stood to go to bed up and couldn’t
even stand up straight. I guess the only way to describe the feeling is
“gut-wrenching”. Not a physical pain per se, but like my brain was
telling my body to stay in foetal position. So I just curled up on the
floor. Sobbing for another hour or so.

                    Hi all, I'm in a terrible way...I am 51, have no job, partner, friends,
money, anhedonia, peyrones disease, bipolar, extreme loneliness & copd.
I want to feel the connections with others again but don't know where to
start. I haven't worked for 6 years due to mental health reasons however
I feel guilty & think it's out of laziness. I busted My partner of 7
years having threesoms with 2 people I used to be friends with. I used
to see her everyday & was totally invested in her that now, I have zero
social life & with the peyrones disease I can't really meet any women!!
I've been used to a life of great success but ever since divorcing my
narcissistic ex wife in 2013 my life has just spiralled downwards at a
great pace. Oh, peyrones disease is a build up of scar tissue in your
penis that creates a bend when erect making intercourse impossible. It
also shrinks your overall size. It's one of the most soul crushing
things for anyone to go through. I am hopefully having an operation
early next year but the surgery is 34k without p/health (which I now
have and am on the 12 month waiting list) but even then, after the
operation, I won't just have chicks knocking on my front door for dates
so I'm scared I'll go through all the pain of recovery and $ spent on p/
health for nothing as I've got no friends to go our with!! (And don't
like going out alone). I just sit at home, sleep all day sometimes as
that's the only time my brain switches of for being such a loser. I dont
watch TV, don't have the radio on, I just go on my pc like YouTube etc
and mind numb myself even more. Idk if I should try and myb start
working again however it's so soul draining on you as a person and tbh,
im on the disability pension now yet I seem to be just as broke as I was
when I was working so I find it a pointless goal to chase. I have
various substance use disorders now also as a result of my messed up
life & it's harder to interact with people re driving to places etc. I
just DONT know what I should do & in what order!?! Pls any advice would
be gold, Thankyou so much.

                    About me: I’m a 37 year old male,suffering from depression on and off
for about 18 years, been on/off medication for it too, but don’t think
it ever really had an effect. No close friends or family, live a fairly
isolated life with a huge focus on my career. My story: 6 weeks ago, I
took a long planned 3-4 week vacation to USA/Caribbean. It had been in
the planning for three years, I had all work commitments taken care of,
I had even purchased a ‘burner’ emergency phone so I could leave my life
behind and live ‘essentially ‘off the grid’ for the duration of my
vacation. The vacation was perfect. Had fun, ate lots, relaxed and got
plenty of sun.But, I’ve really been struggling to come back to my normal
life. Everything has been so overwhelming since I got back. Tonight I
was walking home from work, and a song came on my playlist that reminded
me of my holiday, and I completely broke down. Last week I was at the
cinema, and the movie I was watching had themes about ‘escaping reality’
and THAT also caused me to break down. (it’s unusual for me to get so
emotional in public settings, it used to always be when I was home
alone.) im sure after a while I will just start forgetting about the
vacation and accept that my normal life is, well, a normal life… but I’m
not sure I want to. can anyone relate to this?

                    I’m 42 and have a great job and considered to be funny and intelligent
but every now and then I feel so isolated as I don’t have a partner and
don’t want one. Being surrounded by “normal” people at work chattering
about their partners. Or doing something that people laugh at as they
think it’s “weird” when I’m just being myself. I just want to opt out
sometimes. Not suicide I just mean just not go to work and not talk to
anyone.

gone on in my life recently relationship and family wise .Nearing 50
years old and I just exist ! Nothing makes me happy anymore . Loneliness
and sadness is all I seem to know . There's got to be more to life than
feeling this way ,I just don't know how to find it . I don't have anyone
to talk to about this ,everyone in my life have their own problems and I
feel like a burden to discuss my problems with them. Aswell as the fact
that my immediate family ie partner and kids are the number contributor
to my sadness.

                    Hello all, first time posting on a forum like this. Feeling lost after
having come so far in my mental health journey. To make a long story
short I have struggled with mental health as long as I can remember, and
was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 15. After being medicated
since that age. I'm 26 now, finally managed to kick the meds about a
year ago and was feeling good about it. However, things have been going
downhill since the beginning of this year. It has coincided with my uni
work placement (ironically at a government Mental Health facility) which
has been stressful, unsupportive, and left me feeling pretty useless.
I've been struggling financially, had to stop work and move home, gave
away my dog, and am also experiencing a loss in the family. I am
reaching a point where I feel unable to do anything, let alone help
other people with their mental health. I feel I could either cry or go
to sleep at all times of the day. Nothing I used to enjoy makes me feel
good anymore, and I wake up every morning sick with anxiety. I recognise
these as clear signs of depression, and have booked in with my GP next
week to pursue a mental health plan/therapy. However, I would really
prefer not to go back on antidepressants. I'm not kicking medication
here - it can be a lifesaver (literally) but it took me several tries
over many years to successfully come off it. If I can I would like to
avoid going through that process again. So, I'm hoping some of you
lovely people might have suggestions as to other methods I can try.
Herbal medicines, routine changes, free programs, etc. Particularly
things to help with anhedonia, anxiety, and feelings of worthlessness. I
would really value hearing from legends with lived experience and offer
my sincerest thanks for your thoughtfulness in advance.

                    Hello, this is my first time posting. I have had a really tough 7 months
since I was bullied then terminated during my probation period at a
workplace as a youth worker. I lost a job, professional identity, and
good stable full time pay. I also I lost the sense of confidence and
belief that I truly earned professional opportunities, as the current
job market meant the same resume doesn't get me interviews for the same
type of jobs anymore. I see a therapist, have supportive friends, and a
loving partner. But my relationship with my parents are very strained.
Summary of what happened: I had a friend who used to work at that
organisation. They were the subject of rumours and investigations
regarding their conduct that I had no idea of prior to starting that
job. In one month, I started getting messages from that friend who moved
overseas and told me their friends dobbed me in, alleging I reported her
to my manager. Friends as in my then coworkers who gave me silent
treatments and ignored me when we ran events together, making me feel
isolated, as they obviously got along just fine with 2 other new people
that onboarded the same time as me. At the same time my parents were
visiting, and we had a domestic dispute resulting in the police giving a
home visit, and I for the first time realised I grew up with domestic
violence, and as they were staying at mine, I went to stay at my
partner's and friend's feeling like I was fleeing. In that one month
alone, I drove 50 mins to and from work (5 days in the office), trying
to learn the ropes of the job, dealing with toxic work colleagues and
fake nice managers that only truly showed their colours as they asked me
to trust management to deal with this. In the end twisting teething
issues and honest feedback as me having ""ill intent"" on the rest of the
team and fired me on ""gossiping"". All because my former friend's father
went and threatened to sue the workplace and they pinned it on me. I
have no way of getting unfair dismisssl due to having only been there
for 4 weeks. It was orchestrated and scapegoating. Since then I went
through a manic episode and have been depressive. I got a reception
casual job at a leisure centre and I cop the occassinoal abuse. Not only
do I feel zero fulfilment and shame, I cannot love my partner the way I
want to, because he got a new job after being made redundant, and is
being paid a lot more than me. No matter how suppotive he is, I feel so
inferior.

                    Hi All,Its been now another year since my last post. .My wife is still
in denial, despite still drinking in secret and hiding wine bottles in
random places. She is still angry with the world and blames everybody
but herself for the state she is in. Her anger goes from 0-100 in
seconds, and I do my best to protect the kids from it but feel I am
failing. She won't get help, to get nothing is wrong. If I leave, it
would destroy my kids.We built such a good life together, but she is
never happy. I have prayed for light at the end of the tunnel but feel
there is none. The words that come out of her mouth when she gets angry,
it is hurtful. I believe she has BPD, because if all the different sides
she has. She can be so kind and a beautiful mother, but then becomes the
worse. Not sure what to do next, just wanted to say it out loud. Thanks
for listening .

quite sad. I don’t know how to talk to him and I’m worried about him.

                    Hi , i was feeling pretty positive about my life for the last few months
, getting back into sports, hanging out with friends instead of
self-isolating and even going on a few dates. But it doesnt quite feel
like any of that matters. it almost feels as if everything im doing is
monotonous, low stakes and just unexciting. idk if its because im
experiencing another episode of deep depression or feelings of
worthlessness, but i just cant help but say to myself- ""Im just not
happy"", as cringe as that might sound. worst of all, i have feelings of
longing to be apart of something matters in some way because i dont
think i matter myself. So these deep feelings just sap my energy and
enthusiasm to take risks or do something positive with my life. I dont
quite know what to do. This is has all become like a routine loop for
me, and id like some advice or help on the matter. Because im just tired
of my depression and issues just dictating my life, where i watch time
sprint and the whole world go by while i just waste away.

                    hi. i'm 13, and this is the first time i've done this before. it feels
weird, reaching out, because my whole life i've been forced to hide my
thoughts. it's been hard. like, really hard. i'm in year 8, and being a
major procrastinator, i've even managed to procrastinate getting help
for myself. crazy right? i do get thoughts of 'maybe they don't need me'
or 'what if when my friends say they'll be here for me, they're lying?'.
'im not sure if i have depression, but i'll be honest, if i did, i
wouldn't be surprised. i was told my life by my parents, you can cry,
we'll be there. but every single time i cry in front of them, they tell
me it's my fault and i shouldn't be crying about it. This was like the
time i lost all record of an assignment due in 5 days. i cried, really
heavily, and my mother then proceeded to say, ""thank god it's gone, i
thought the look was horrible.""im sorry what? That was 6 hours of
nonstop work and thought and she says that? really kind mum, you're such
a saint.My amazing dad then said, ""Why are you crying about this when
it's your fault? Honestly you're 13 grow up."" He then said i wasn't
allowed to cry, said it was pointless.i also did try to talk about my
suicidal thoughts. I did, i really tried. But my Chinese parents just
said, you're just lazy. find some initiative, get some discipline for
god's sake, why are you like this.my parents are 'perfect' people.
always top of their class, discplined, 'never needed help doing
homework, my parents were divorced and my grandma didnt know how to do
it' blah blah blah. sometimes i think if it's worth waiting the 5 years
for a chance to study abroad and be free for once. my parents are ok
with me hanging out with my friends, they i could go to the easter show
with them next year, but they can be so annoying and overprotective and
i just dont know how to deal with this anymore.and i just know my
parents won't help me in any way. i cant get a therapist on my own, and
i dont think i can book my own medical appointment, and my GP is also
chinese. please help me.

                    Hey, I’m feeling lost and like there is no direction for me to go in. I
usually follow my gut and persue anything that interests me however, I
can’t latch onto anything and everything seems so exhausting. I’m a
bright side kind of person and don’t know how to talk to others without
this lens. I’m wondering if anyone has advice about how I can sustain
direction/joy/flow in my life and not be so alone with this bleh
unproductive version of myself

                    Hello! Hey there fellow people on this wonderful forum! I am posting for
the first time. I should have got a job years ago! Seriously if it
wasn't for my oblivious thinking back in High school, I would have got
one when I was like 14. That is what I should have done, except I got
one when I was 17, was there for like two shifts, then left because the
idiots sent me to the wrong house! I was a delivery driver you see. I
should have stayed but wasn't resilient enough and quit. Fast forward to
now I have been looking back on life and concluded that I should have
got a job literally a decade ago, I am 24 now, so when I was 14. I would
have been in a much better financial state and had loads of cash to go
towards a home loan. Instead I have less than five grand and I am 24! I
have now only just managed to get two jobs, both of which I haven't
started. This has deeply depressed me, but I am doing fine, thank god
for job seeker payment!!! Also thank god for my good saving habits over
the past decade or so. I really wish I got a job when I was 14 or even
15 and stayed with it! I would have had a much better Resume and found
it easier to get other jobs. Is anyone else in this position when they
look back and think to themselves 'I should have got a job sooner'? Is
anyone else in a bad financial state? Luckily I am a good saver and what
a good life for my self. I am willing to work hard and what the best for
myself!!! Please feel free to offer up some advice for me, thanks in
advance. Hopefully these two jobs work out!!! I do not want to be fired
for any reason! For motivation what I do is go to carsales and dream of
what cars I could own in the future, I love cars!!! I also look at
property for sale and think to myself 'yeah I got to work hard so I can
have a good life and have a nice townhouse or house"". You know what I
mean? Thanks in advance for all who reply! I will really appreciate it!
Thanks.

                    Misophonia.. possible ADHD and definitely on the spectrum. This makes me
hypersensitive and very literal but miso is Killing my marriage. Or is
it already dead. My husband has been through hell and back with cancer,
and continued health issues. The latest being coughing and snotting
constantly - no end in sight - it’s been 5 months since it got bad. I
cannot stand to be around him, and when I am I can’t help but tell him
to shut up. Separate bedrooms now which I thought would never happenI
want to be around him. I miss our previous relationship. But I can’t see
things changing. I’m lonely, no one to talk to so bury myself in work,
horses and art. I feel like I’m grieving, and feel also guilt all the
time. I try to just go about life - I feel so sorry for him but that
doesn’t help me to co trip how I feel when I’m around. just wish I could
have someone to talk to when I feel like this. have had plenty
counseling over the years and also recently. No real solution to my/our
problem.

                    I've felt low this past week, not feeling like my usual self. I feel
alone and isolated. My support system feels non existent. The people in
my life who I could depend on to listen are not available. I feel like
my life is unbalanced right now, like the scales have been tipped and
everything feels heavy and hard to face. Any small thing that goes wrong
adds more stress to my body and is hard to process. Hoping that these
feelings will pass and thinking of anyone else who is experiencing the
same thing right now.

                    I have been playing sport for as long as I can remember and about a
month ago I obtained an injury in one of my footy games. I ruptured my
ACL, which meant that I required surgery. I am now 3 weeks post surgery
and I just feel so lost. I feel like I can’t do anything and I find it
so hard to talk about with everyone. My boyfriend has been my absolute
rock during this period but I just don’t want to burden him with these
feelings. I just don’t know what to do anymore

                    im a school leaver, I left at the end of year 10 because of bullying and
""friends throwing me in the trash"" (discarding me) I was also bullied a
lot about my weight even when I have managed to maintain that weight for
2 years, at the end of year 9 a boy called me a hippo and made big belly
hand motions, after that I left school that day only 10 mins into class,
ever since then I was never concerned with my weight and how I look now
and all the negative emotions and feelings settle in. I got bullied for
my weight even more in year 10 including people starting rumour of me
being lesbian (not saying anything bad, its just upsetting when people
call you something your not and make a big deal about it). at the end of
year 10 I left and am now in tafe doing childcare, I'm only 1 semester
in and now I just don't know anymore, I feel empty and lonely, I no
longer feel happy and cry everyday also having an emotional breakdown at
my job the other day I had to leave and go home, I believe I'm also
stressed from all the assignments (5 assignments due in same week) but I
don't know how to identify it. I also don't have a free day to myself
anymore 5 days tafe then weekends are work. iv tried to talk to my mum
about it but she don't really listen saying its ""adult life"". I don't
know what to do anymore. has anyone ever felt like this?

                    I am a 32 year old male, 33 tomorrow. I am going to spend my birthday
alone, as I spend most days. I work full time 5 days a week, and every
second Saturday. I am suffering from extreme loneliness, I do not have a
single person I would call my friend, even co-workers behave more like
adversaries or bullies even threatened to kill me (jokingly I think). I
have no family to spend time with either, they are either disinterested,
busy or contribute to negative mental health. I am really struggling to
navigate what it is to be entirely alone as an adult, I don't really
know how to enjoy anything because my depression and loneliness takes up
the majority of my mind while I'm trying to be present.

                    Hi there! I'm wondering if anyone has been through anything similar or
has any advice as I feel lost and I've been trying for so long and just
can't get better.I've had health anxiety for many years, however the
last two years I've developed quite bad stomach issues that are chronic
now and never go. Which makes it very hard to live day to day life.I
have gord, chronic constipation, bloating/tightness which literally
never goes away, its so bad to the point where I can't even breathe
properly most of the time, burping, regurgitation, heart palpations,
chest tightness, I get all kinds of weird feelings in my chest and
stomach, abdominal tension, nausea, terrible digestion. I take tablets
for the reflux and try so hard to not get anxious but I feel a bit stuck
in a loop. My stomach problems are always there and I try not to let it
trigger my health anxiety but it's so hard. I've talked to my doctor
about it many times but she can't find anything wrong with me apart from
maybe ibs.It's debilitating and I feel hopeless at this point.

                    Hi, this is my frist time doing this, im not quite sure what to do but,
yeah. Anyway, I had just finished semester 2 and was on a 3 week break,
the first thing i get told when i get home is that my granddads cancer
is back and they won't be a ble to stop it this time and he has 6 months
at most left, so that was a great way to start the holidays, so my mum
went up to Queensland to be with him before his operation to remove
parts of the cancer out of his stomach so they can put a tube in but its
a very dangerous surgery but if they don't put a tube in he can't eat(
he can eat but the amount of cancer in his stomach makes him full really
quickly). So anyway my mums been up in Queensland since about 2 weeks
ago the surgerys been pushed back many times due to complications. So
now we are just waiting. These holidays I've also been to a funeral of
my best friends dad and my great Nan. I havent seen my Mum for like 2
weeks and i know she'll be home soon and shes up there for a reason, so
ive sorta just been stuck in like a blackhole for a bit, And i know i
just dumped alot on everyone and im sorry but i havent told any of my
friends bc i don't wanna seem like im trying to draw attention to myself
or anything and i can't talk to my dad bc my brothers going through alot
at the moment with major anxiety and i know its hard for him to, but
yeah. Im happy to chat to anyone, about anything, i was just hoping to
talk to someone about what i feel and not feel like a burden on anyone,
but ill talk about anything with anyone. Im a Huge AFL fan and love
being creative and drawing

                    Hi thanks for letting me join. I am hoping.g that by being on this forum
that I might learn techniques on managing my health anxiety. I have been
a suffer since I was a child. I find .most days are crippling with
anxiety and the only way I Manage to have a few hours of peace is by
going to work part time in the afternoons. While I am working I have to
completely focus on my client and what their needs are and this means I
have no space in which to panic

                    Hello Everyone. Long time no talk. I am struggling with anxiety again. I
currently work 3 days a week. The pay is good but I have this feeling in
me that I should be working 5 days a week as I feel bad for my husband.
I know in my heart that I can't handle 5 days a week but my mind is not
helping. My middle daughter left her stable job as she wasn't happy and
now cannot find another job. She has less then $100 left in her bank
account and she is struggling mentally as well and I don't know how to
help her. My youngest daughter who has a medical condition is not well
at the moment and can't seem to get better so things are pretty tense at
the moment. I had a bit of a light bulb moment the other night in
regards to my mother living with us (which I am not happy with). I
realised that I don't understand why I am obligated to take her in and
care for her when she didn't look after me when I was younger.I just
honestly feel like everyone would be better if I wasn't here with my
issues but I don't know how to fix them. Sorry, I know it might not make
sense I just needed to get it off my chest.

                    A consultant at work was given some chocolates from a patient and left
the clinic without taking them. One of the other doctors working with
the consultant said I should take them home because I don't think she
will want them. A week later the the consultant had been asking around
who took them. The doctor who said I should take them home said she left
them with the nurses and the nurses would keep them safe. A few people
asked me if I knew what happened including the consultant which I lied
and said I didn't know. Ever since, I have had bad anxiety thinking I am
going to get in trouble. I have asked a few friends and family what I
should do and if I should replace them. They have all said to not worry
about it but I can't stop worrying. I might need more or better advice
please.

                    For years, I have been feeling empty when I am by myself. I hate this
feeling. I often try to have people around me by spending money on them,
taking them out for dinners. While I am generous, I don’t want to use
this behavior to cover my empty feeling. I want to feel cheered up
without needing to be around people. I want to feel motivated to do
things for myself. I want to live for myself, not just because I have to
live and do my best for my young daughter. I am unable to leave the
house if I don’t have someone with me. For instance, I force myself to
go to the grocery store for groceries. I see psychologist every
fortnight but I go back to the empty feeling as I walk out the
counseling sessions. How can I stop this madness?

                    I have been doing so well for a couple of years on my old medication and
now suddenly I am so much worse again. I feel jittery about little
things, my mind is going crazy from just thinking if I have to do some
housework and my mind gets overwhelmed that I get physically sick. This
morning I had to call in sick again and usually I was able to push
myself to just one sick day a month! I feel physically week and run
down, just no energy to do anything but lie in bed, but have to push
myself today to go and get my new medication... I am so angry at myself,
nobody will put up with this for long and I am trying to do the right
thing but feel more and more frustrated with things around me. If I
leave out something in housework or to do, it all piles up and making me
more and more overwhelmed

                    Hi there,I'd appreciate your thoughts or suggestions on what to do about
knowing people are talking about you behind your back or if you suspect
they are talking about you behind your back. There have been times in
the past when this has been overwhelming and confusing because, what are
you supposed to do in this situation? It can bring on a sense of dead
and insecurity and I'm not sure how to respond to it. I'm the sort of
person who avoids conflict but I've also noticed this is very common in
today's society where everyone is comparing themselves and using social
media, which has increased the amount of gossip, misinformation, and
dare I say it 'bitchy' behaviour in general. Sometimes I have overheard
people talking about me in a way that they have clearly misunderstood my
intentions or who I am as a person, but I also want to keep the peace
and not confront anyone. Anyway, I'd appreciate your thoughts!

                    So I have had experience with severe anxiety in the past, to the point
where I can't eat, can't sleep and literally can't sit still. I have
gotten through it in the past after basically just waiting it out and I
thought I had overcome it. Something has triggered my anxiety again
yesterday and I am struggling to pinpoint why. I feel like I can come up
with lots of 'this could be why' explanations or maybe it's all of the
things. My main symptoms is a sick churning feeling in my stomach.
Sometimes it is constant but at the moment it is on and off. It stops
when I am distracted by something but as soon as I let my mind think
again it comes strait back. I can barely eat, I am force feeding myself
just so my stomach doesn't hurt from lack of food but I have zero
appetite. I wake up every day feeling nauseated for as long as I can
remember, I honestly feel awful on waking but I'm not sure why. I am so
tired and groggy from constant worry but I can hardly sleep. When I do
fall asleep I wake up in the early hours worrying and heart pounding. I
have a beautiful partner but they don't know how to help and it is not
up to them anyway. I think I am stressing about my work but my work
isn't THAT stressful so I think it's my personality mostly. I have tried
all the techniques but I just feel like it's a case of riding it out
again which sucks because I don't know how long it will be pure torture
for. I hate myself for being this way, my life is not otherwise
uncomfortable. I can't predict when this will happen which makes it more
devastating when it does. Why can't I just get peace? It's my brain
that's broken so why can't my brain fix it?

                    Work place gossip is getting on top of me right now. I'm currently
struggling with a lot of things in my personal life and I've still been
doing my job but I haven't been as motivated and I have had to take days
off. I know taking time off can cause coworkers to respect me less but i
can't handle work when I'm having panic attacks or need to sort out
appointments and my living situation. There are lots of office politics
and I'm a supervisor at work and I've had another co-worker tell me
things bosses have said about me that they're trying to ""catch me out""
and they dont want to critise me incase it effects my mental health. I
also worry this co-worker is repeating things I say to the boss as well
and she has bragged about being the bosses ""spy"" and I thought I was
friends with this person. The bosses talking about me like that has lead
to other issues with undermining and talking about other staff members
and calling them useless. I tried to talk to my boss about it but I
don't think they handled it very well and said my coworker is ""getting
too big for their boots"" and immediately brought them into the office
after, i wasnt trying to start drama i wanted to know how to handle the
situation and stop any bullying of other team members. She tried to
blame shift onto another manager though and she either is in the dark or
pretends to be. Every aspect of my life is crumbling right now and my
mental health is suffering. I don't want to quit my job if it's just
paranoia. I try my best to focus on my work and avoid drama but it got
the best of me and my confidence is gone. I want to talk to the boss
about taking time off but I know that's going to cause more gossip. I
have wanted a new job for a long time but if I leave I know they will be
short staffed and pissed off. I know I'm not the type of co-worker
people might want to be around because of my anxiety. They have done a
lot for me but I don't feel like I can keep working like this and I
don't want to be that person that is just complaining and worrying all
the time. This is my first good job and I've been there 3 years with no
issues like this until recently. I really struggle with social
interactions and the boss said they trust me and I'm important to them
but then they're possibly talking about me behind my back. Rather than
talking to me they'll probably cut my shifts for a while. Has anyone
else's stress and anxiety caused them to quit a job? Is this normal
workplace gossip or potentionally toxic?

                    And got diagnosed with severe anxiety. I didn't know it was this bad.
Like, obviously I knew it was bad....but severe?? I should add that I've
has anxiety for a while just as a general handbrake on my life. But now
it's...yea. It was, I suppose the first time I was truly honest with
what was happening. The doctor I had was great too, it wasn't a tick and
flick exercise for her - I felt truly listened too. How the hell did I

                    Hi. My daughter suffers from bad night sweats as a symptom of taking
Anxiety medication. They appear to be hormonal as they occur when she is

                    Hi guys, it’s already a month, the company dismissed me. It is unfair
because they can't reprimand one of our co-workers. My co-worker is my
senior, I thought he would help me to learn but he is bothering me even
more in my work. I was being yelled at, all my output was wrong as if I
was stupid, and I also questioned myself. I can't sleep well, I can't
eat, I don't feel hungry, I just lie down all day, I try to get up but
my body doesn't want to. I have lost weight, I don't even know how to

                    Hello all, I previously posted here a couple of months ago about my
current situation. Since then, I have had a few days where I have been
good and have been able to manage my anxiety, but as of late, I have
been struggling to get out of the dreaded dark hole of ""doctor google or
doctor youtube"" and I have self-diagnosed myself with something drastic
because my doctor ""missed something"". There have been times when I would
journal but have found it difficult to make journalling a routine to
write something good about that day - if that makes sense. I kinda am
the person that I would be a listening ear for someone during their hard
times, but when it comes to myself, i tend to flick it under the rug and
go about my life. I have hit a brick wall.

                    Hi, I am 14 in year 9 and live in Australia. I am a high achiever, I get
good grades, am house captain, and get some academic awards. so most
people think I am fine but I am not. I have panic attacks every day and
always feel like my mind is a black hole of empty nothingness that will
never be good enough. I am pretty good at faking a smile and only crying
when I am alone but sometimes I just can't and people always judge me.
School takes up so much of my energy that I am usually stuck in bed for
the rest of the day as soon as I get home because it is too hard to get
up. whenever I tell someone they are always surprised and I am scared
they don't believe me. I am on medication and go to therapy but if
anyone has any suggestions on what I can do to not feel like this I
would appreciate it. thank you.

                    Hi,I'm extremely reluctant making this post for all the obvious reasons,
but reading some of the other posts here has given me the courage to do
so. I'm 48, have had s.a.d for at least 35-40 of those years and have
never sought advice on the subject. I've never been diagnosed
officially, and have only started to fully accepted the fact recently,
due to a problem I'm facing. A problem I had managed to avoid up until
this point in my life. I have done some reading online over the years to
get an understanding of my condition and believed I understood it well
enough. I spent my teenage years and most of my 20s completely ignorant
and fighting off depression. After realizing s.a.d was the main cause I
was able to move past the depression, or so I thought. Gradually I chose
to live a very isolated life and not rely on other people for my own
happiness. I have never been able to hold a job for a long period of
time, or had many friends that ever lasted particularly long. I have
never found any true happiness, but in recent years I had found peace.
There has always been a personal reason that has allowed me to get out
of bed each and everyday. The peace I had found always had a clock on it
and I knew it. It gave me both the confidence and motivation to step
well out of my comfort zone and that seems to have backfired on me. The
combination, of my s.a.d and lacking social skills which have
deteriorated over time, has left me extremely confused and disappointed
to say the least. I am capable of, participate in, and enjoy short
social interactions. However I have never been capable of speaking to a
gp, or anyone really, face to face about mental health. Any advice on
moving forward after a huge reality check and setback would be
appreciated. I'll say thank you, now, for reading...and any replies, as
I'm unsure if I will respond to any. Sorry hope you understand.

issues with shame. I am aware my unhelpful thinking style makes me jump
to conclusions and assume people think I'm stupid, pathetic, weak &
useless. And I know it isn't true, but in the moments that I talk to
people, I find I lack the confidence to think differently. I don't have
a diagnosis of ASD or ADHD, and I actually have a good amount of friends
which one might not think of someone with social anxiety. But I can only
be myself around 'my people' or only certain kinds of people. I'm an
introvert that can sometimes pass as an extrovert but I'm always
extremely drained after social events/work. Here are some examples for
context:-At work, I struggle to have conversation & make eye contact
with my boss. I am afraid they will discover I am not cut out for the
job. I'm also hyper aware that they are an 'extremely business-minded'
person, and I sometimes feel my interactions with them are not
genuine...People that are in authoritative positions, especially older
men, I find extremely difficult to talk to. I sense that they write me
off as 'a silly' girl.-I attend a writing group once a month. During the
group, I am so uncomfortable in sharing my opinion about someone's work
(because it involves speaking in front of people I don't really know)
that I can't concentrate on the writing they are reading aloud. Everyone
is able to give solid feedback, but I struggle to remember what they
even said as I was panicking about speaking!-Lastly, when people ask how
I'm doing, how my writing is going yatta yatta, I start rambling.
Because I don't feel like I've accomplished much with my life I always
feel embarrassed talking about the fact I work part time and I struggle
to write because I'm feeling depressed...but I can't say these things!
I'm probably rambling right now! Sorry for the long post...I'm after
advice, materials and strategies to combat these issues. Does anyone
else ever get moments when you disassociate in a conversation, or think
about trying to make eye contact when someone is speaking that you
really struggle to stay in the moment?

                    I am a 63 years old spinster who has a few mental health problems to say
the least. They include anxiety, OCD, paranoia, depression, agoraphobia,
social phobia, hyper-sensitivity and suicidal thoughts to begin with. I
have been isolated for decades with no friends or contact with my
family, which is my fault as I have isolated myself and I don't want to
be a burden. They once told me I'm very depressing and negative which is
probably true. I find it very difficult to connect with people because I
mistrust them and over think everything they say to the point I am left
exhausted. I'm on medication and it helps with my OCD but nothing else,
and like many others, cannot afford counselling. I retired in 2019 as I
had a breakdown at work due to bullying. I have no self confidence, and
see myself as repulsive. I only leave my house once a week to food shop
and I cover my face with a large hat and wear sunglasses and have
headphones on to try and hide. I wish I knew how to enjoy life on my own
but have been made to feel such shame and guilt. I'm also being bullied
by my neighbours who play cruel jokes on me so I often ring Lifeline
when it gets really bad. In Feburary they set off fireworks right
outside my house which terrified me as the sparks landed in my front
yard and roof also they like to tip my wheelie bins over. I've never
bothered any of them but they are a small gang of four roughly the same
age as me but unlike me they are very social. I can't remember the last
time I felt safe and happy. Sorry but I'm feeling very overwhelmed with
life.

                    Hello, I am new to these forums so I hope you might be able to help me.
I am constantly in Fight or Flight mode. My son is going through a very
nasty custody battle with his partner who is a Narcissist, though I
think she is bordering on Psycotic. There are constant lies told by her,
false accusations to Police and instances trying to 'frame' our family
to stop us having any access to our grandchildren as well as keeping our
son away from his children. I am always on standby waiting for the next
lie told, the next time my son has to make a statement to Police
regarding her false accusations , it never ends. I can find no one to
help us. I feel my anxiety is out of control, headaches, panic, bitten
fingernails and unable to relax due to fear of this person. I'm hoping
someone might be able to help control my anxiety, so I am better to cope
with the next allegation. Thankyou.

                    Hi everyone! Little backstory to me - I’m in my 30s, have a fair bit of
childhood trauma (was born with a physical condition and went through a
lot of misunderstanding, discrimination and bullying, though my family
is awesome). In my twenties I lived in a religious community where I
experienced emotional and psychological abuse. I left that community two
years ago, very unwell with anorexia (which I now know was triggered by
trauma). Since then I’ve had a lot of PTSD issues. Flashbacks,
irritability, nightmares, heightened anxiety, self-blame for what
happened, and social/situational avoidance. I’ve not really been treated
consistently for the PTSD. I met my fiancé last year and we are getting
married in October. My fiancé is wonderful, honestly the kindest person
I’ve ever met, and he has been so accepting of me and my issues. I
really want to marry him and I know we are meant to be together. But I
just can’t cope. I can’t cope with the fact that someone wants to be
with me because all I hear are the messages from my trauma. I don’t feel
good enough, I don’t feel deserving of goodness, and being loved and
wanted just feels like too much. I’ve been having a lot more crying
episodes (picture full-on sobbing) and triggers lately and I wonder if
it’s connected to that. Talking about this makes me feel a bit dumb,
because who would be upset or anxious about being loved??? My natural
instinct tells me it’s much better for me to be alone, because then I
can’t be hurt and I can’t hurt other people, but I can’t really do that
in this instance. I think the crux of it is that I feel so incredibly
undeserving of all the good things I have, I just can’t cope with
goodness, and it just feels like way too much. I’ve talked to my fiancé
about this a little and he always tells me I am deserving and he loves
me, but I don’t want to overwhelm him with this. I’ve felt very happy
planning our wedding day, but now thinking about it makes me feel a
little apprehensive - not that I don’t want to marry him, just that
having such a day celebrating us feels like way too much for my brain,
because I don’t deserve it.

                    Hello, Im sure other people suffer from health anxiety and I do too, and
it’s really bad. Considering my age, I’m very young but even the tiniest
throb, headache, cough worries me and it’s draining me faster and worse
than my own health can. It’s extremely scary and I can’t seem to find
people with similar constant Symptoms that come with their anxiety, no
matter how much research I do so I’m convinced it’s something bad. Which
makes me feel unmotivated to do absolutely anything, I leave things to
the very last minute and I can’t even keep up with basic hygiene because
I feel like there’s no use, also makes me feel awful. When I do get
random boosts of motivation (rarely) or feel like I can calm down, I
immediately can’t anymore, I tense up or get even slightly anxious that
something bad will happen after that and that’s the only reason I was
allowed to be “normal” for a bit, so I leave that and force myself to
feel more down and empty, But in general everything feels meaningless at
the same time. If anyone feels similar I’d love for a reply!

                ",ANXIETY

                    I have been doing support work for a couple of months and really love
it. I’ve got three clients at the moment, which is great as it balances
well with my part-time job. I came into this work after living in a very
structured religious community for almost ten years. Like everything
being accounted for, often being supervised and criticised on
performance, having very little independence. I left that life very
unwell with anorexia and now live with that (I’m recovering) and PTSD,
which has been dealt with on-and-off by professionals. One client is
seriously unwell and has support workers round the clock. They live with
family and they have set up a really clear system and routine for
support workers. Support workers sign in, there’s a handbook for them,
they need to record all the tasks they do, etc. My client is so lovely,
but they’re also very assertive and direct. They are great qualities,
and this might sound weird - I find myself a bit scared of them at
times. Dealing with very direct people reminds me of my past, because
directness has often turned into personal attacks, and because I was
always expected to be perfect, all the time. I also find the routine and
environment gives me a lot of flashbacks - being supervised as I do
housework, being directed on chores to do, etc. Sometimes I actually
dread going there. And it’s nothing they are doing wrong, these are all
my issues, and that’s what makes me feel bad. I have thought about
ending with this client, but I feel terrible doing so. I feel like I’ll
let them and their family down because they need support. Part of me
thinks they will understand if I explain it. I really love working with
them generally, it’s just these things which have hit me unexpectedly. I
guess I’m looking for a bit of perspective here….? Thanks!

                    Hey everyone, I posted for the first time a few months ago and kinda
wanted to track my progress. I’ve recently gone through a lot of new
experiences with starting uni and a new job which have been quite
challenging. New things bring up a lot of anxiety and it is often super
hard to deal with. I honestly I didn’t think I would be able to do it as
I often cut experiences short due to overthinking and panic. However
I’ve taken the time to reflect on the past few months and realised that
I am indeed still surviving. Though it’s not easy and I feel like shit
most of the time - like I’m too stupid for uni or I’m doing my job
completely wrong, which led to a bit of a breakdown in front of my boss.
And that no one likes me and all my friends want to leave me; I’ve
realised that I’m actually sticking with it all. This is the longest
I’ve held a job for (the last one I quit cause the thought of doing
things wrong was too overwhelming), I’ve been getting good grades at
school and I’ve even managed to make new friends at uni whilst still
being in contact with old ones. it’s so hard to recognise my
achievements when it seems like other people do all those things so
easily and I’m drowning. But I’m proud of the fact that I now am able to
take a step back and recognise that I am doing the things that I thought
would ruin me everyday. Maybe this means I’m getting better at dealing
with my troubling thoughts? I just wish I knew how to deal with things
better in the moment. Hope everyone is well, just wanted to vocalise my
thoughts.

                    Hello everyone, I have had anxiety for the past 15 years and I managed
it as best as I could. I was diagnosed with GAD and PTSD and I am only
38 years old, but the GAD has been around forever. My main problem is
physical symptoms of anxiety. I have acid reflux, sometimes I vomit
acid. Blood work came back with fatty liver, high cholesterol. I've also
had high heart rate and high BP. I 'self medicated' with non-alcoholic
beer (around 100 beers a month), high fatty foods and lots of sugar. I
have this embedded fear of dying young, but in the same time I do next
to nothing to improve my wellbeing. What concerns me the most is that
from time to time (recently they have begun to appear more frequently),
I get these vomiting and coughing spouts. I usually vomit acid, which
may be from the stomach. Today I vomited twice. I am afraid of
revisiting the doctor and I don't quite know where it is coming from.
Can someone please share their diet and acid reflux+anxiety stories? Any
useful information will help so that I may start doing something to
improve myself. My only vices are my bad diet, non-alcoholic beer and I
play video games a lot. As I type now I have this fear that an anxiety
attack might resurface and I will be awake at night or have interrupted
sleep. Thank you!Jordan

                    Hey, I know I'm not alone in struggling to accept and move on from a
breakup. It's a tale as old as time and something most everyone has
grappled with at some point in their life. It's been three months since
my partner and I broke up. We were together for five years- I believed I
would marry this man. I imagined our future life-he and I often talked
about it. Having children, creating a life and a home. And three months
ago that came crashing down. I thought with even this small passing of
time (3 months) I would be feeling better- if only marginally. I feel
worse. I am able to function in my life, my job, my self care routine.
But the pain of missing him, all the hopes, dreams and plans we made
play out in my head. I know it's a grieving process, he wasn't just my
partner, he was my best friend, my family, someone who was always in my
corner. I really loved him. Still do. I am just so exhausted from this
pain of not having him in my life. Of missing him. Everywhere I go, I'm
reminded of five years' worth of memories- all with him. How do you
learn to let go of someone you thought would be in your life forever?

                    Hello. My mind will constantly pop up with negative social memories from
my past, particularly from late primary school and high school. I've
been having this issue since around 2018. I'm in my early 20s and
haven't socialised much since, hence not many opportunities for new
negative memories (but some exist). Context:I've had persistently
negative social experiences for a long period (or so I perceive). I was
a very shy kid. From around the age of 10 I felt I was being mistreated
socially, my mental health became overall negative, and has been there
ever since. The core beliefs I have developed are something along the
lines of ""I'm unlikeable"" and that ""I don't know how to socialise"". I
remember having severe levels of social anxiety in school (sore stomach
before school, constantly keeping hands in pockets, being unable to
speak properly, etc). Whilst I'm socially anxious now, it's no where
near to the same extent. Although my ""social performance"" still feels
inadequate. Types of Memories:- Times people mistreated me (bullied,
excluded, mocked, etc.)- Instances where I perceive that people disliked
me (telling me to shut up, giving me that ""why are you here"" sort of
look, etc).- Embarrassing things I did (usually the things need to imply
that I'm unlikeable or socially incompetent, otherwise they aren't a big
deal)- Times I was bad to others (I didn't do this super often, but I
feel severe guilt about it) My question:So, what can I do to
assuage/stop the constant reliving of negative memories I experience?
Even if I assume I am unlikeable etc., I just don't see how constantly
reliving the memories serves me. It's torturing me for no benefit, every
day. It feels like something unresolved that my mind has been in severe
strife about for a very long time. I understand people with PTSD will
relive their memories, but that's much more understandable to me, it
would be very difficult to process those sorts of experiences. It's
driving me insane. Is this something I just have to accept until I maybe
solve my social isolation/struggles in the future? Is this some rare
issue only I face? What do I do?

co-workers, one in particular for a while now. I'm not the only person
being bullied by her, nearly everyone has been bullied by her. It
started when I returned back to work in 2021 after recovering from a
back injury, she was a new hire and constantly on my back about every
little thing. Eventually I told her that I know exactly how to do my
job, if the manager has an issue with my work she can bring it to my
attention herself and that she should focus on her work instead of mine
as I was feeling harassed.Since then she started reporting ME for
bullying HER. For example, I was on the phone with a customer and at the
same time she was speaking to me and started to raise her voice to tell
me inaccurate information about what she thought I was discussing with
the customer. With the call on hold I told her I was busy with a
customer, I've got it thanks, but if she wanted to speak with me, she
shouldn't be yelling misinformation at me while I'm with a customer. She
immediately went into our managers office, I go back to my phone call,
customer heard the yelling asked if everything was okay. When the call
was completed I can hear her crying to the manager and when she comes
out of the office and passes me she gives me the stink eye before
leaving. My manager comes out a few seconds later and she told me that
she saw everything that happened through the mirrored window between her
office and the reception office where I work and that the co-worker had
reported me for my tone and disrespect for ""ignoring her"" while I was on
the phone. Similar instances kept happening to the point where I
isolated myself from her at work because she would turn any interaction
we had into me bullying her. Making me anxious about any interaction I
had with her, costing my job. Other staff members came forward to
support my version of events a lot. But everything still takes its toll.
I remember reporting her for non-compliance with our employee code of
conduct for promoting her private business to customer that would come
to our workplace after I had multiple phone calls and people walking in
to reception asking for her to discuss her business. The senior manager
at the time said I was being PETTY and to only report serious matters.
Now, I feel like I can't report her for her bullying towards me. Even
though my direct manager sees whats happening, the Senior manager (who
now works in the HR department) favors my bully.

                    I’ve been through a lot.but lately it’s been my youngest boys 2
surgeries and my dog having cancer removed. His tail was amputated and
another mast cell cut from his leg. It hasn’t healed, so I’m taking him
to the vet 3 x per week to get his dressing’s changed and I argued the
removal of his cancer with my husband. I’m the one taking care of him
all the time and taking him to the vets for his dressing change! I’m so
angry and upset! I’m the one who had to get my son’s leg cut off and
reattached with massive surgery!!!!! I’m always the one trying to make

                    Hello,I have always been known as a shy person whereas my older sister
has always been very outgoing so I felt like I grew up in her shadow. As
a child I found it hard to see my positive qualities and never saw
introversion as a strength because everyone around me criticised me for
being shy and I grew up hating my shyness. Maybe because of my shyness
or other reasons I always felt self conscious and rarely felt
comfortable around people who weren’t my immediate family. When I was 7
years old my family moved country and I rarely saw my loving
grandparents again and felt like my family consisted of only my parents
and older sister. During my teenage years I struggled with disordered
eating and despite doing well at school felt very self conscious in
class and found everyday things overwhelming and felt like I was out of
step with the other students. I found it difficult to envisage what I
would do as a career but wasn’t too concerned because I still had a lot
of time to decide. I decided I loved art and music and tried to force
myself to do drama so that I wouldn’t be so shy. When I was 17 my
parents decided to divorce. It came as a shock but sort of validated why
I had felt unhappy as a teenager. Beforehand I had started to feel
distant from my parents and they had been going through other things
they had reason to be stressed about. My Mum had suggested I talk to
someone about my disordered eating but I felt so much shame and distrust
in people that I hated the idea. I also hid how I was feeling and was
already known to be shy so not many people seemed to notice how unhappy
I was. Now I’m in my late 20s and I’ve finally seen a psychologist for
about two years. I recently moved to a new city and although I’ve
completed a bachelor degree in science I’m finding it hard to get a job.
A lot of the same feelings have come up that I used to feel, they’ve
never really gone away. I do understand myself a lot better than I ever
have in the past and now see there are strengths that introverts have.
But I’m still struggling to enjoy my life, like myself and make friends…
and being unemployed sucks. Sometimes it just feels like I can’t catch a
break. I’ve been through so much and would love to have a healthy
romantic relationship, strong friendships, a meaningful job, and enjoy
my life but sometimes it feels like I’ll never get there. I am starting
to blame myself for not choosing a definitive career path sooner. I
committed to university only to come out the other side with more doubts
and uncertainties about my career than I had when I started. I feel like
I’ve missed out on so many opportunities because I am an introvert. I’ve
worked so hard at my education and the most recent jobs I have had and
still feel like I’m never doing the things I truly want to be doing.
I’ve also struggled to accept my sexuality and have disliked my body
ever since I returned to a healthier weight. So there’s been a lot for
me to deal with and maybe I’ve been self sabotaging myself all along, I
don’t know for sure. Today I just felt really sad and unsure of what to
focus on in my life because I have a lot of interests but something
always seems to go sour at some point and I stop doing something I once
loved

                    Do you have Dissociative Identity Disorder? Many people live with D.I.D
all over the world. DISSOCIATIVE IDENTITY DISORDER Dissociative identity
disorder is a survival mechanism of the brain. It is more of an ability
that keeps a child alive throughout continual and ongoing abuse in early
childhood. Much like surviving a traumatic car accident, trauma to the
head can result in the brain shutting down in order to cope with the
enormity of the damage afflicted. The brain is protecting itself. With
D.I.D this then results in shutting down of self also. Memory becomes
separated and these separated memories may remain dormant until they are
accessible again in later years when memory recall of the abuse events
become active(flashbacks). The memories are also affected at the time by
the child's perception of self and the world around them. Memories
combined with self perception contribute toward the development of
individual parts of self. These separations also called fracturing
create new and separate sense of self resulting in separated parts of
identity. The separated parts of self then become individual and can
function separately from one another with individual characteristics and
personalities. Not all separated parts have a personality they may only
carry characteristic traits. The original term Multiple Personality was
changed to Dissociative Identity because this is more than just
personality changes. The new name now used, DISSOCIATIVE IDENTITY
DISORDER, is because of the extreme level of dissociation needed to
survive the abuse and the reason the separations are able to happen.”

                    Hi all, I have been out for a long time from my profession and just
recently decided to go back. I am having lots of anxiety and worries
since I started my training. I saw how everyone is fast and able to do
their task on time. I got so scared that I might not be able to cope
with fast pace of the job. I am thinking that I won’t be able to catch

Next week they will give me task that is making me more anxious.
Thinking that I should give up this profession.

                    Struggling with no supportI’m a young mum to a toddler, trying to
navigate relationships, working full time (I have 2 jobs) and nursing
full time.Safe to say that’s a lot for anyone to deal with day to day.on
top of this, I have been struggling every single day of my life since
childhood. I’ve been experiencing debilitating anxiety since I was 6
(granted I always thought I felt guilty for no reason but didn’t
understand the feeling till I got older)I used to tic a lot as a kid and
many other issues like that which were never taken seriously or followed
up on by my parents. Instead they would shame me about itand this has
snowballed to the point where I’ve experienced multiple traumatic events
and I’m struggling to process it all on top of my day to day life, this
anxiety and everything else happening in my brainI notice One normal
issue anyone else experiences really takes a toll on me and I
internalise all my emotion with itI struggle with reaching out for help
I always have. But I have made steps to outwardly tell my partner or
family or friends but they seem to picture me as someone who “handles
everything” and any advice they give just seems so superficial and
vague. Stuff like “oh but you’ll work it out like you always do
:)”Helplines and counselling services are just as uselessI seeked out
professional help but sadly I’m not in the financial position to pay
$300 per session a weekI don’t know what I’m supposed to do. It seems
wherever I seek help in the places your supposed to, they don’t work and
when I try talk to my ‘support’ I feel like I’m not being believed or
taken seriouslyI don’t know what to do but I know I can’t keep living
with this burden for the rest of my life. I’m so overwhelmed most days I
constantly think of ways I can try to run away or escape everything…
this isn’t healthyWhat should I do?

                    Hey, so I have been bullied in the past when I was in highschool, at
work and even at home by my younger sister, who is four years younger
than me. I get stuck in a position where it feels like I can't think of
any comebacks. It's like I freeze on the spot and anything I do try to
say gets dismissed or they have the upper hand. They have the
satisfaction of winning the argument and get away with their negative
actions. And I feel like such a a loser. It feels like no matter what I
say to anyone, I would just get ignored or overlooked. Because what I
have to say doesn't matter. Am I weak for never thinking of a comeback
or something that would stop bullies in their tracks? And it feels like
my Mum sides with my sister because I'm older and I'm usually the mature
and reasonable one in the family. I always try to be kind to others so
does that make me a easy target. A punching bag people can throttle so
they can feel good about themselves. I know most people are going
through a hard time like my sister but I don't think it's fair to take
it out on me. But if I try to fight back, it suddenly feels like I am
the one in the wrong because I'm told I need to be more considerate of
those struggle even though they're taking it out on me. It's not fair.
It's like I am in a catch 22. No matter what I do, it feels like things
will always be unfair. Am I weak for not even thinking of a solid
comeback?

                    Hi, I'm new here but I'm not new to anxiety. When I was in high school I
developed this fear of assignments and public speaking, at one point I
went to the doctors and he diagnosed me with social anxiety, he
prescribed me medication but I refused to take it. I didn't want to
fight this with drugs, I just wanted to be able to over come it. Myself.
And I did, well the public speaking part. One day in high school I had
to do a long speech and ever since then I slowly got over my fear of
speaking in public. (Sounds simple, but it wasn't!) Don't get me wrong I
still get nervous but I've learnt to push my self into situations where
I have to do presentations and speak in class discussions. But the
anxiety when doing assignments has never really gone away. I
procrastinate to the point where I either rush the assignment or I leave
it completely for the next day (past the due date). I am in my final
year at university and I am still absolutely terrified of doing my
assignments, and I think its gotten worse because I have gotten more
busy, with uni, on top of work, family stuff and searching for a job. Is
this what I am going to be like when I start a job and have to complete
tasks on a deadline? I don't understand this irrational fear and it
frustrates me because I KNOW I can do it, its not like I don't have good
grades. I think its the fact that I'm being judged that ultimately
scares me. That people will be looking at my work and being like thats
just not good enough or you haven't done it right. I think thats why I
procrastinate, because If I leave it to the last minute then I don't
have that time to sit and worry about it and all I care about is getting
it done and submitting it. But I do care, I care about what marks I get
and I end up hating myself for not being able to start it earlier or
finishing it on time and thinking I could have done better if I started
earlier. In the end I'm writing this because I need advice, how do I
finally get over it? I have literally started smiling in the mirror
every time I need to start/ continue an assignment because apparently
you can trick yourself into thinking your not scared. Is it working? not
yet. But hopefully soon. Otherwise if anyone has any suggestions on how
I can overcome this anxiety that would be great, because I am sick and
tired of repeating this cycle. I just don't want to feel this way
anymore. Thanks in advance to anyone who replies to this - BeBrave

                    I’ve called in sick to work the last two days. I’ve had a sore throat
but also just so tired and burnt out. I’ve realised I’ve taken one sick
day per month since I started the job, is this bad? But if I’m burnt out
there’s obviously a pattern here meaning I’m not coping. Everyone at
work has been fine with me not coming in but my mum has made me feel
guilty. She has subtly suggested that maybe I’m not that sick/being
lazy. She doesn’t understand that I’m so tired just from going to work.
I’m on the hunt for a new job that will be better conditions and less
stressful hopefully, but in the meantime I’m dealing with a job where I
have to at least stay back an hour everyday to get everything done. On
top of everything, I feel like I have ADHD and am keen to investigate
this and whether this is contributing to my struggles at work.

                    Hello. I am finding it really difficult to function atm. I have had
anxiety like this for 2 years. My husband and i own our own automotive
workshop, which I wanted to sell 9 years ago. So doing something I don't
want to has been a stress. Then his mental health and health problems
added to that. 2 years ago I hit a wall as one of our employees was
thinking of leaving, and I lost all thought and function. I rely on him
alot and panicked, but a week later with mods and some belt tightening
he stayed. Have had a few really good years and in a better position
then ever, then last year things slowed down and it flared up again, the
panic of going back to juggling everything, but all came good. No it's
happening again and this time it feels worse. I can't bring myself to do
my work and I just don't want to be here. It's been almost a week but
this is the 3rd day like this. I just want the panic to go away. I can
handle things without the panic. I don't know what I want from this but
I am trapped. BTW the business is on the market and has been for 2.5
years. Good business just no one has the cash. Thanks for reading if you
made it this far.

                    When I think about it, I've always had anxiety. But this year it has
spiked and made working very difficult. I am a teacher, and feel like
there is no space for mental health conditions. You can't just leave
your students for a quick break. You need to show up and put on a
facade. Every. Single. Day. Last year I found teaching and my general
life very easy and fulfilling. But this year, every day is so hard. I
bought a house at the end of last year and am struggling to make ends
meet. I've had a lot of sick leave without pay and can't keep doing
this. I started taking antidepressants at the beginning of the year and
don't feel like they are helping. I am experiencing depression and
suicidal thoughts, which I've never had before. I used to love life.
Part of me wants to run away, sell my house and live out of the car. But
I don't know how I can come back from that. Has anyone else had a
similar experience with antidepressants? How do you keep pushing through
the discomfort and go to work every day when it makes you physically
sick? I can't keep doing this for the rest of my working life.

(maybe anxiety). It is all very new to me and troubling. I have tried
breathing techniques ‘smiling minds’ and Dr prescription medication,
which is helping. Next step was a psychologist but none are available
right now. So I tried a self help group in my area. It was a very
rewarding time and would recommend it. My question, is a self help group
a good substitute for a psychologist?

                    Hi, well what a few months it has been. Last Friday was the first
anniversary of my sisters passing and although it was difficult, it was
nice to be surrounded by family. It did bring up a lot of feelings and
emotions though. lots of sadness, anger why it had to happen at all and
I miss her dearly. On top of that work is getting worse by the day, the
constant behaviour management all day every day, the copious amounts of
reports, data collection and emails, the phone calls to parents, and
writing behaviour records. Then there is the everyday prep work to be
ready for lessons. It is never ending and it is nothing for me to
complete another 4+ hours of work at home each night. So how is my
mental health in all of this?? Not great. I feel like I am slowly
drowning - the water level is lapping at my chin and soon I won't be
able to breathe. I am attending therapy once a week and whilst it helps,
its the days in between that are difficult. Some days I just want to
stand on a mountain somewhere and just yell and scream until I feel
better. And other days I just want to crawl up in a ball and cry my eyes
out and wait for the world to pass on by. I am in two minds about
returning to my doctor and going back on anti-depressants. I stopped
taking them about 6 months ago. Anyway, I should probably try and get
some sleep......

                    I find it extremely difficult to hold down a Job for years. If I tell
you about my past maybe this might help with someone trying to
understand. I lived over seas for some of my child hood until coming
down to Australia and being placed in a boarding school. I was diagnosed
with ADD when I was very young and I also have a very low borderline IQ.
So learning new information and keeping up with the speed of this crazy
world is difficult for me. I've never been a selfish person or a greedy
person. I just thought that if I could put my problems out there someone
would be able to understand, or if they feel the same way towards my
thoughts. I was only told of my limitations around 5 years ago by my
parents (I'm now 40 years old) I find it difficult to read and retain
information too. I've accepted my fate and I'm seeing a psychiatrist how
ever the medication does not seem to be working so now we are trying
psycho therapy soon. I get easily influenced by people as you can
imagine, with having a low IQ so problem solving skills are not good.
I've given up on the world and I've accepted my fate. I'm not adapting
to this crazy world and I've struggled my whole life with absolutely
everything. I hope someone out there is able to understand or share
there experiences which are similar to mine. I've found the transition
from childhood to adult hood absolutely crazy and I've been trying to
keep up with the world, but frankly have given up.

                    Hello to everyone this beautiful Sunday, I have woken up with a stress
headache once again, caused by one person who has been vile to deal
with. (He is a customer not family) All of last week he was deliberately
complaining about absolutely nothing, being abusive towards me and my
staff. He was deliberately causing confusion and mixing up orders to
test me and my staff. To test our service. Calling late at night and
becoming an absolute nuisance of himself. I mean calling at 10pm on
Friday to complain. I was already in bed trying to recover from the
harassment I had been subjected to all week. Yesterday I was having an
anxiety attack because of not sleeping and this morning, Sunday,
Mother’s Day, he started again. The phone calls from different numbers,
the messages and videos and voice messages, he sent emails at 11:30pm to
stress me out about nothing. A error of his own making. And again
calling staff this morning to place an order and then call 30 minutes
later to cancel it. Just to create unnecessary work. Why are some people
like this? I want to scream every expletive I can think of at him but I
have to bite my tongue as he’s threatening to post nasty poor reviews of
my service online. Tomorrow, I will be telling him that I can no longer
provide with any service as he’s threatening to cancel his account
anyway. I want to tell him that I don’t need his business. What is wrong
with someone like that? I haven’t cried yet, but I feel like punching a

                    Hi! Just putting this all out here to see if anyone can relate because
I’m quite stuck and really struggling and nobody close to me understands
what I’m going through. I developed health anxiety November last year (7
months ago), I’ve always been scared of death but this is a whole new
extreme, i started having panic attacks daily that eventually turned
into a 24/7 panic attack that lasted 8 weeks, my mum had a brain
aneurysm when i was 6 that burst, i was meant to get a brain scan at 18
because they can be hereditary but i put it off until November and I’m
now 20. As soon as i had the scan done is when the panic started, I
convinced myself I was about to have a brain aneurysm burst, I wouldn’t
leave my room, didn’t sleep, couldn’t eat, could not function for 8
weeks and was stuck in a constant panic. I went to emergency multiple
times and had 7 doctors tell me the scan was clear and still I wouldn’t
believe them. About a week after I accepted the fact my brain was okay a
relative passed from a heart attack, he was in his early 30s (has had
major health issues his whole life) this then made me convinced that I
was going to have a heart attack, still to this day and it is so
debilitating cause once again i can’t sleep or do anything, i don’t go
out anymore, i won’t go further than 10mins from my house and won’t even
go into shops. It has gotten a lot better than at the start, once again
multiple trips to emergency, multiple ECGs and been told countless
amounts of times my heart is fine and healthy and i’m also very young
still. Now one of my friends went into anaphylaxis from almonds randomly
with no previous allergies, now i’m to scared to eat and when i do eat
my anxiety convinces me im going into anaphylactic shock I just really
need some support or advice because this has gotten so out of control
and I just want it to stop

                    First of all, I can acknowledge that I have come a long way since
hitting the depths of rock-bottom a few years ago. And this forum
helped. I sought therapy, got some life managing tools, turned a corner
when I left a toxic job and since then, have experienced a healthier
mental headspace and over body shape. My problem is....how quick I
spring back to hating myself, blaming myself for everything,
highlighting my failures and being uncomfortable with any positive
validations - I feel dishonest like I'm fooling people. Am I addicted to
anxiety? Is the daily effort, to ignore the self critic in my head, for
the rest of my life? Because thats too much work. I get acknowledged at
work or someone praises me, I list things that I do wrong instead. And
I'm such a friggin dweller. Cannot move on from a mistake or a comment I
made even though noone is bringing it up and hasn't caused consequences.
I can't sleep. I can't function. And I have a great network of family
and friends around me but I feel selfish to burden them with I'm not
coping with Life. I feel like a failure at everything. I hate myself. I
annoy myself. I'm surrounded by a network of supporters but I feel
selfish to lean on them. Why cannot I feel joy, be grateful...why is it
easier to accept I'm a waste of space, im fooling everyone that I have
my shit together .I'm not house proud, don't do enough homecooked
dinners, I'm on the phone lost in cyberspace where I can be helpful or
liked, instead of cooking and cleaning for the family. I always make a
good impression and then I retreat. Like I'm going to give you reasons
to not like me. This affects Work. I come in as a social butterfly and
then I start second guessing my ability to do the work, start thinking
I've disappointed everyone and I just spiral. My Manager said last year
""you're not the same person we interviewed"". She didn't mean it in a
negative way at the time. She was encouraging me to be kinder to myself.
I. Have.Not. Let.That.Go. I feel guilty like I started working there on
false pretenses. Sometimes I feel like I'm playing so many different
roles that when I'm alone I realise the real me is the one I hate the
most. Pathetic, lazy, unorganized...I've convinced myself that whatever
anyone else sees is an illusion. So that being said what do I need to do
to feel better about myself? How do I switch of that inner self critic?
And do I just embrace I live with anxiety and whatever tools work, yes,
I'm going have to use them every day for the rest of my life? I need the
second phase of my life to look different. I don't want to be a burden
to myself and others anymore. I want to feel lighter. I want to see the
positive and lean into it. Most of all, I just want to be able to say
""Oops. Noted. Moving On."" I hate living in my head. I hate that I know I
have plenty to be grateful for but feel unworthy of it. I hate I didn't
pursue my dreams because I wasn't good enough so I seek impossible
perfection in everything that I do - deliberately I guess, to remind me
I failed to be successful. I hate that I've taken up someone's time
reading this rant when they probably have bigger problems than me
feeling defeated by Me. All I know it is a horrible feeling to close
your eyes and feel nothing but hate and anxiety towards yourself. I've
been told I'm a good wife, mum, friend, colleague, relative....instead
of feeling joy, I'm devastated that I've duped them somehow. If I'm
destined to live like this just please help me with the spiraling? How
do I stop the negative cycle in my head from snowballing? I want to
sleep. I want to proactive around the home. I want to give Work the
hours it requires and switch off and go be present with my family. I
want to be more present with my family and friends. I want to feel joy.
I want to look around me and everything and everyone that I love is
around because I deserve it. That's it, I guess. How do I feel worthy of
my life?

                    Hi, I'm new here and came with the need to rant so please don't mind me
as I do. I currently have many problems in my life that give me anxiety
but there is only so much I can talk about, so I guess I'll share one of
them here since I have no one to talk to. I have been wanting to get
this off my chest because its been eating me inside and been giving me
so much stress. I am a student currently living by myself and have been
experiencing financial stress over the last couple of months to the
point where I have been skipping meals and just barely making my rent. I
am someone who does not make friends easily and only have one friend
group which also happens to be my classmates at uni. One of them in
particular comes from a wealthy family and everyone knows her as ""the
rich one"". I consider her my friend but I know deep down that I am
jealous of her because I can't help but compare myself to her. Unlike
me, she is a very fortunate and lucky person who somehow always gets the
best opportunities that I don't. She's a talkative person that likes to
flex and sometimes overshare the good things in her life. Couple months
back, when I saw her the first day back to school, the first thing she
told me was how much money she made during the break and how rich her
company was. It makes me feel bad about myself because I know I can't
share my financial struggles with her and I always think about how much
of a failure I am compared to her. I know she doesn't mean harm and is
actually a sweet girl, but sometimes her flaunting is annoying and gives
me unnecessary stress. I remember one time I got very annoyed at her
because she tried to give me ""advice"" on how to act and do my job better
when I was actually the one who had more work experience and a higher
qualification than her. She's also part of our close friend group and I
realized that most of my friends actually like her more than me, which
makes it even more discouraging for me. I don't want to feel this way
and I know its not good to compare myself to others but it's so
difficult not to feel inferior around her. I don't want to lose my
friend group as they will be with me until I graduate so I try to endure
it but I am suffering. I am trying my best to earn money to get out of
my financial situation but I know that I will never reach the same level
as my friend and I can't help but feel like I'm not enough and that I
will always be in financial stress.

                    Hello and thank you for all, It is difficult to get your thoughts down
on the page when you are anxious and depressed. You lose your
assertiveness and ability to say what you what to say. I'm Nick, guy who
is middle age, and I have a diagnosis of social anxiety and depression,
from my early 20s. I've just started a teaching placement which will go
until the end of May, 4 days a week. Today is the second day and I've
called in sick, but I'm not. I get stressed, emotional and anxious in
any new situation, not just this one. I am very sensitive to criticism,
and I have a history of getting fired from jobs, because of
non-attendance and making mistakes. I feel deflated and sometimes will
start crying when I think about my life. Luckily, I have a great Mum and
Dad, brother and sister-in-law. My parents are both in their 80s, so I
take this into account when talking about my mental health. To be clear,
I will talk to them, and they will notice, when I am not well, but I
think about their health and worry. The medication I take 'seems' to
work at times, but my mood can be volatile and I don't deal well with
criticism. I have used CBT to work through things, but it is not enough.
I am not bipolar, I don't exhibit manic behaviours. I am not sure what
else to say, as I feel sluggish in my thoughts, and want to rest now. I
appreciate those who have read what i have had to say, and hope you are
ok. Nick

                    Has anyone realised this, and restarted in a completely different field?
How did you do it - or the reverse, did you think that but it ended up
ok? I’m so unhappy and stressed all the time, work becomes my entire
life. My work is high pressure in that deadlines can be very demanding,
but it’s also quite complex and means dealing with lots of different
people who have different views etc. I’m a people pleaser and a bit of a
perfectionist so that really is challenging for me. I keep imaging an
escape and it’s always something like a wildlife rescue in the country,
or even a florist, or a librarian, or anything else. I feel like I’m
just not cut out for my work - everyone says how good I am it but they
don’t see the toll that it takes on me? I feel like resigning, ending my
lease, moving somewhere and just escaping it all but I can’t do that
financially. I doubt I’d ever have the courage or follow through as
well, I’m terrible with decisions and just get paralysed and do
nothing.I also don’t trust myself though, like is this just me in the
moment? Would another job just be exactly the same, because it’s about
how I react to things? Would being somewhere totally new and alone with
no one really be the best idea?

                    Hi all, I'm new to this and looking for some advice for some one that
has been through what I'm going through. To keep it short it started
about 3 months ago now, I went to see my Dr with a bit of chest
discomfort and as my heart rate was elevated he called an ambulance to
take me straight to the closest hospital. Upon arrival they did a ecg,
ct scan and blood test which all came back clear. They desided to admit
me into the cardiovascular ward as my heart rate was still over 100.
From there I was monitored 24 hrs, had another ct scan and an
echocardiogram all which came back normal. A month later I was back in
the emergency department as I had my first heart palpatation that felt
like my heart was jumping around, to me it felt like I was having a
heart attack. They did bloods, ecg and it all came back normal, however
they wanted me to conduct a holter monitor test. I did the test and it
came back that I had 24 pre beats in the 24 hr period and that my heart
was perfect from an electrical side of house. Since then I have now been
checking my pulse religiously as I have felt weird pains and tightness
around my chest, tightness in my neck, light headed from time to time,
have even noticed a visible heart beat in the hollow part of my neck. I
have even started to notice that some times when I'm standing up for a
period of time my heart rate remains over 100 even though other times it
has returned to normal. Since then I have had a few panic attacks and
developed anxiety over this. My issue is that even though I have been
told and reassured from my Dr that every thing is fine with my heart, to
me it still fells like something is wrong especially when I notice my
heart rate doing weird things and or feeling the physical symptoms as I
have mentioned earlier. I've tried hard to believe what the Drs tell me
but I still can't shake the feeling or thoughts that there is something
wrong. This is starting to control my life as all I do is worry about
it. Any help or advise would be greatly appreciated.

                    Hi everyone, I don’t know if this will help but I feel like I need to
get this off my chest.. I am in my 20s and I feel overwhelmed and
anxious all the time, I don’t know what to do. I have talked to a
professional a couple of years ago after a panic attack (never had one
before) but her advice was not helpful and it’s just getting worse. I
have been feeling ill lately, I’ve seen my GP about it and she did a
heap of test that came back ‘unremarkable’. It’s been 2 or 3 months and
she is out of tests to run on me so I keep feeling sick. I am wondering
if it is my anxiety that’s causing the issues and if it is I feel like
there is no hope of getting better. On top of that I feel undervalued
and not challenged at work but I am too worried to talk to my manager. I
struggle falling asleep every night and wake up a lot too. I have
chronic headaches that have been more like migraines lately. I feel
tired and unmotivated and things that I used to like don’t seem
enjoyable anymore. I thought about going to my GP to get a mental health
care plan but I am so worried about the cost involved with all of that
and also don’t believe it would help anyway. I get too emotional most of
the time and feel like I’m either really happy or really sad. I don’t
like to leave my house alone so I never do anything when my fiancé is at
work, I don’t have any friends and I don’t talk to my family as much as
I should but I have nothing to talk about so I don’t want to bother
them. I don’t know what to do and I feel like I’m venting too much.

                    Hi EveryoneI have suffered from anxiety and depression since I was a
kid, I am now in my mid 30's and I just find myself feeling more lost
and overwhelmed, as each day passes, by everything and everyone.Nothing
seems to get easier, only harder!My mother is a narcissist, my partner
of 10 years is possibly bi-polar (I say possibly because I was told he
was diagnosed before I met him but went off his medication because he
didn't think he needed it) and I dare not bring it up with him, and I
work with someone on a daily basis who is a worker like me but seems to
think it is their duty to micro manage me because they can't cope unless
everything is the way they want (ocd!)I constantly feel like I am
fighting a losing battle with everything, feeling like I am standing
there just digging the biggest hole underneath myself and soon it's
going to be too big for me to get out of. I feel as though I'm
constantly being watched and scrutinized, as though I'm not allowed to
have a voice, or if I make a choice, it's wrong. Is there anyone else
out there who has similar issues? or who feels like this? How do you
cope / get through each day?Best wishesLost Soul

                    Hello everyone, I can't believe it's been 6 years since I last posted
here! In that time we have all been through a pandemic which challenged
us all, and I have lost my my beautiful brother to cancer. My anxiety/
panic attacks settled down for awhile and I actually felt like I got my
life back. But, here we go again and this time I cannot cope, its
relentless, not so much panic ( which is a blessing) but anxiety each
and everyday! I hate the morning's, I wake after only managing 4 hours
of sleep with anxiety, racing heart, palpitations, shakes, sick to the
stomach and there really is no reason why. I miss my brother terribly,
we spoke everyday and as he was a sufferer too he got me, now he is gone
I have a loving family but I just want to wake up and be happy with what
the day will bring. Im seeing my doctor regularly and a psychologist and
come away from the appointments feeling positive but then another day
starts and so does the anxiety. My doctor has changed my medication to a
new one and it's only been 7 days on, I know they take time to work and
I'm probably expecting a miracle. But this time around I can't see light
at the end if the end of the tunnel. I have a 21 year old son who is
suffering terribly with OCD and other issues, he misses his uncle badly
too. Im trying to stay strong for him, but feel I'm falling apart.

                    My therapist has recommended I undertake study in a course that more
suits 'me' in order to help me find what I enjoy, find my 'dream job''
(if that even exists?!) and 'make me come alive' ... in hopes to also
bring me out of a depressive state and hopefully my quarter life crisis.
The course I have chosen and enrolled into is a Diploma of Design (which
gives me the option to study subjects in Graphic Design, Fashion,
Interior and Game Design) my passion (I think) is Graphic, Fashion and
maybe Interior, however I am one of those indecisive people and can
never seem to pick something and I like to have variety (even in my job
too), so hence why this course appealed to me. The things I am
struggling with is self doubt, pessimism, lack of confidence and feeling
like I am wasting my time with studying this course as it is in industry
that doesn't have a lot of stability, which is something I have always
wanted so hence why I chose another path when finishing school. I know
my parents have steered me away from this area as 'where would that
lead??', ''whats wrong with where you work now?'' ''why can't you just
be happy so that way people can see that you are happy in life and
approach you to date'', ''change your attitude'', ''be grateful''
,''pray about it - what does God say?'' etc. I am feeling overwhelmed as
I haven't studied since 2017 and also a brief attempt at uni which I
pulled out of early on due to, well similar reasons and finding it too
hard (Diploma of Business. I work in Admin & Customer Service for the
past 10+ years), so this time I feel more pressure to make this work and
I want to push through my mindset issues and see if this might lead
somewhere. I have fallen rusty on time management skills in the last few
years also and can't even keep my room clean like I used to, get up
early enough to style my hair and put on makeup. This is due to my bad
habit of being on my phone too much, I could achieve so much if I wasn't
on my damn phone!! however I also use it to set reminders, timers,etc to
help me stay organised too it is a double edged sword.I also find myself
getting distracted easily and am not a fan of reading, I never was in
school either. When I read and I lose focus and forget what I was
reading, my eyes dry up and/ or I fall asleep, so that is another worry
I have as well. Trying to stay disciplined and positive to persevere
through it all! My course to due to start in a month and its online and
I am getting increasingly overwhelmed and feel like I want to tap out,
but I don't know how to push through. Breathing techniques I haven't
found to be helpful, they seem to make my thoughts louder and I feel
like it is all too much. Almost like I need to get everything right
before I can proceed to the next task. I find myself asking what is
wrong with me? Why can't I do even a simple task??

                    As long as I can remember I’ve always struggled to keep a friend for a

nursing. I don’t talk to anyone I did sports with or went to school
with. I’ve been waiting for that to start to make like minded friends
but that’s just been pushed back another 4 months. I try talking to old
friends from my high schools but I fall onto deaf ears, and I know it’s
not necessarily me but the different positions in life we’re in and
experiences so we don’t have much to talk about. I feel like I’m in such
a hole, I don’t have the energy to go out and make friends- even if I
did, I find myself shying away out of fear I’ll be “too loud” or “too
much” as previous friends have suggested. I know I’m digging my own
lonely hole, I’m 16- I feel like I should have more friends than just my
mum( she’s 17 years older than me so she’s like a sister) though she’s
awesome.. it’s just not the same. I want someone to hangout with,
sleepovers, go out to the beach or stuff like that. I don’t know what I

                    About six weeks ago my partner of five years (on/ off again) decided to
separate for good. We were both very upset (lots of crying/expression of
love ) . I feel incredibly sad, unable to stop crying these last few
weeks. I recently got a job offer (dream job) in another state. My ex
and I were potentially planning on moving to this state together. I
accepted the job, but am feeling so overwhelmed as I am moving away from
family into a new state/city where I have never been and do not know
anyone. Not to mention it's a move that really finalises/closes the door
on my relationship with my ex. The past couple of weeks, I have felt
such acute anxiety (especially at night). I know a certain level of
anxiety is normal as moving somewhere new, away from your family is the
'unknown'. But this feels so amplified by the loss of the presence of my
ex in my life. I feel utterly lost. Staying feels unbearable as there
are so many memories here and I fear sliding into a stagnant state. And
moving is terrifying as I know I will feel isolated and lonely for a bit
of time. Has anyone ever moved interstate after a breakup? What helped
you cope with feelings of loss, anxiety, loneliness? Thanks for reading.

O OCD three years ago when i was 50 and not going to lie it was an
extremely challenging period in my life with a brief stint in hospital,
but as challenging as therapy was and is eventually there can be a
freedom that can help release you from the prison within your head . it
was only after being diagnosed that i was able to look back and see how
much of my life was driven by OCD , the best advice i was given at the
time was to educate myself on OCD first as i think that is a massive
step forward to be able to understand what is OCD , second and the
absolute most important thing was to find a therapist that is
experienced in dealing with OCD as lots claim it but i dont believe some
are well enough trained in that specific disorder , the third thing for
me was being able to open yourself up at therapy and do the work as OCD
is very paradoxical , facing your fears with the help of your therapist
i believe was the best way , i wanted to write this for the people new
to this disorder to give them so hope so that they can find the courage
to seek help and move forward and not let OCD dictate their lives, there
will be some difficult days but they will get better ! three years ago i
was on medication and having rigorous therapy and now i am off
medication and touch base every now and then with my therapist and feel
much better , OCD along with Depression still challenge me but i have
the tools and the understanding of the disorder to calm myself down much
quicker , there is light at the end of the tunnel you just have to make
the first step, to the people caring for someone with OCD remember if
you find it hard, imagine how they must be feeling not being able to
understand themselves , so i tell you, you only need to help them by
being understanding and not necessarily having to understand the
condition , i think it is also important that the people caring for them
get up to speed on the best way of helping an OCD person as it will be
just as difficult for you because often it will require you not to offer
reassurance.anyway i wish everyone here who is suffering to go and get
help because it is there and whilst not perfect it will help ALOT !!

                    Hi, first time poster. I have been dealing with a toxic manager who does
not provide support to me at all. I dread coming to work everyday, with
massive anxiety, panic attacks, heart palpitations and feeling like
vomitting before work. I know I shouldn't let it affect me this much but
it does. She belittles me, points out everything she thinks I do wrong,
when I try to stand up for myself with all the accusations she has
against me, I am shut down and she makes excuses pinning things back on
me. I know I am not in the wrong, that I know, because I do the work
that is given to the best of my abilities but it's not my fault the work
lacks direction and clear expectations which then leads her to say I'm
not doing the job right.. anyway it sucks because I'm not financially
stable to quit my job. I'm also trying to find new jobs too but no luck
so far. This anxiety is sometimes getting too much it's affecting my
personal life (lost of appetite, being distant to friends/family) and I
don't know how to handle it while I'm still here.. I don't know how to
handle such a toxic manager who doesn't hear me out or sets me up for
success.. any advice would be great, thanks.

                    I’m in a relatively new job, been there 2 months. Work in a school so
just had the last 2 weeks off for school holidays. The last 2 days
before the holidays I had off due to legit sickness (stomach bug) then a
reaction to my new anxiety meds (I assume) and a panicked late night
phone call to a friend to come over because I thought I was dying
(biggest panic attack I have ever had). I just now over the phone turned
down an extra days work a week (that I had agreed to before the
holidays) as I desperately feel the need to have a day to myself (single
mum of a toddler, plus an exhausting & emotional few years - mum passed
away, had to move house twice, completed a course qualification, and
being a single mum with very very little support). Anyway, due to go
back to work tomorrow and I just don’t want to! But I’m not even sure
why. I know I haven’t done anything wrong by taking legit sick days, I
know I haven’t done anything wrong my turning down an extra days work.
Still, thinking about those things makes me panic.And, I don’t even like
the job… I’m looking at other employment opportunities. If I had to
blurt out a reason, I feel it’s the people.. and again I can’t pinpoint
why. There’s a few personalities that I just can’t take to, and am
somewhat ‘fearful of’ for lack of a better term.I do have a bit of
stress trauma from being bullied in a previous position back in 2012.I
just hate feeling this way! Makes memiserable, panicky, scared and
really sad…. and I bet I won’t sleep well, if at all tonight. Thank you
for taking the time to read this, any advice would be amazing

have you had to struggle with asking questions repeatedly and have
frequent conversations about the same things? Does this annoy others? if
so how do you deal with it?

                    My husbands siblings have organised a holiday together without even
asking us, it’s made me really upset. I feel bad for my husband as he’s

to act like everything is normal around them, I just don’t know what to

                    Hello, I'm coming here because I couldn't really find anything else, and
this happens pretty much every time something like this happens. I'll
just be looking at messages/gc's and sometimes I'll see that someone's
unfriended me. I think all of the cases have been people I don't really
know all too well, but it makes me feel awful. I question all of my past
interactions with the person trying to just understand why, like if I
did something wrong I'd wanna apologise because that wouldn't have been
my intention! I know that usually it's for some other reason and that
the person probably doesn't spitefully hate me, but like it really wears
on me, and I usually can't sleep for ages or even do other things. I
guess what I'm asking is there anything I can tell myself or any ways to
stop thinking about this, since it ultimately doesn't matter but yeah...

made an appointment with a doctor. I feel really scared though because I
don’t ever go to the doctor for anything, and I havent seen this doctor
for so many years that I’m really scared that they’ll judge me or won’t
believe anything I say. I’m really anti social so I feel like I won’t be
able to say what I wanna say or I’ll say the wrong thing causing them to
just dismiss me and move me along without helping. I’m just tired of
feeling alone, depressed and just worthless but I’m really scared to

                    I have been with my partner for 11 years. He has a controlling x partner
who he shares custody of kids with. The 13 year old does dance 9- 1 hour
classes, the 15 year old does 3 drama classes and is working about 2
times a week. We have recently had to drop 1 class each due to the fact
we cant get them there. We received a not so nice messages cause we
should be able to because she can. We don't care about the kids and
don't want them to be happy.We are so proud of the 15 year old getting a
job but she is controlling how he uses the money he earns. $180 in a
weeks pay has been broken down to $20 to our house $40 to spend at her
house and $120 to save for her house. ( big pay due to school holidays)
They also have phones but she is using that now to control our weeks.
She doesn't use them to communicate and say hi etc or anything that
needs to be communicated she is using them to see what is going on at
our house. ( she has a tracker also on the phone) so every time we leave
the house there is questions about where we are going. oh your not going
to school today? no the bus was just late. oh and it was great the day
that we were making the 13 year old go to school when she didn't want to
so her mother told her to go to school as normal on the bus so dad
doesn't know and walk down to her work. That's just a brief on some of
what's going on. I'm at a loss of what to do, i hate seeing the kids
upset cause she is trying to control our weeks. i know we don't know
everything and are learning every day but does that mean she gets to
make all the decisions for the kids cause i know no parent gets it all
right, am i wrong in these thoughts?She keeps all awards, trophies makes
all the decisions, never lets us know of excursions, even the ones that
fall on our week, don't know of doctors appointments etc not allowed to
get there hair cut, not allowed to buy extra dance, drama uniforms for
our week, kids don't tell us much cause they are scared of making her
angry. We let it all go to save the kids cause when we were trying to
fix it the kids were even more upset then they are now. cause she just
keeps saying i do what i want and you will do what i want because that
is co parenting.. I'm just so depressed not be able to just live our
lives and it is ruining our relationship and i can't deal, these kids
are my world to its bad enough to have to share kids for any parent let
alone feel like we are being controlled all the time and cant live our
lives because of it.

                    The last few days I've been falling deeper and deeper into
depression.I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I had health
anxiety at first for a week which subsided after seeing the GP. And then
my depression kicked in and has been working in overdrive. It almost
feels crippling, I cry almost everyday several times a day.I'm in my 40s
and struggling with finding a partner and feel like my time has past.I
also can't let go of my past, constantly thinking of things I could of
done and should of done. I see people's past on social media and makes
me depressed how I couldn't have the same experience. Maybe if I want a
family I would feel embarrassed sharing my life choices.I also can't
stop thinking about death and how I don't feel like I have much time
left.

                    1) Society only conceives themselves and they don't try to understand
others. Everyone's bias and no one can disagree with themselves
typically. 2) People either cause your problems, they otherwise don't
care, or they even potentially enjoy hearing about them with some. 3)
Advice and support is usually cliché, interaction is superficial, often
the only redirected recommendation is shrinks that leads to detrimental
pharmaceutical treatment and involuntary clients who feel invalided and
become victims. 4) I can't relate to my nationalities culture, only
since my generation globally is following a unified consensus to not be
interested or believing in Christianity Religion or with being all under
the same political left wing mainstream consensus. I find their
indisputable with any of their popularised views and they argue with
illogic. They project their insecurities too often and they can't have
as much meaningful or broaden conversation, everything's usually
awkward, weird, or whose cringe, a hipster, desperate and they feel
things are worth addressing. I don't like their music since 2008, their
too into Andrew Tate, women aren't prude. I only like older generations.
5) The 21st Century is horrible, people are high consumers and overt
materialist's, which than makes them more socially superficial, shallow,
narcissistic, insincere. Their less emotional courtesy and manners
today, people are more grandiose and with potential audacity to not
care, it's too much with financial net worth and being entitled. I don't
like globalism - diversity. 6) Everyone's more innocent until proven
guilty and they won't take needed accountability, they have no humility
to be wrong anymore, they treat sincerity and make it that your so
humble or rare, to normalise to feel & be mental, fake and laugh at
what's true or say that it's strange or weird, but to be guilty of the
same acknowledged things. 7) I couldn't relate to my father. I am a male
cultural misfit Christian Fundamentalist and my father is a generic
misogynistic that's chauvinistic, sexist. His got no issue with the
bloke culture in my opinion and he is stoic and selfish, His not
creative. He tries to vicariously live his sports team through me at
times and he diverts his illiterate limits onto me that I'm dyslexic.
His potential with rarer jealousy and puts his average mediocrity on a
pedestal with being the bread winner and the family bill payer. His
sister and family is narcissistic and with dysfunctional differences.

                    I'm 27 in 3 weeks. I'm still living in my parent's home with parents who
continue to control how I manage my money, won't let me drive on my own,
not even pay for a home/apartment. When I try to do chores (such as
washing clothes or fixing a light bulb), they criticise how I do it and
take over. When I was with my father at Coles, and I tried to pay, he
butted in and gave the cashier his card. She looked at me as if I was
spoiled. My mother is excessive to the point she has given away my
clothes, belongings and changed furniture. She's looked through my
wallet and once confiscated my card, because 'I spend way too much'.
She's criticised my 'sexy dress style' and told me to 'lose some
weight', hence why she's given them away. They've recently become
concerned that I'm still single and unmarried, and are pressuring me to
'give them grandchildren before they die'. While they pay for my taxes,
fees, and support me financially, they don't care about me emotionally.
When I've felt down and upset, they would mock and dismiss my problems,
telling me to just get over it'. They laughed at me when having dark
thoughts, saying it's nothing compared to 'them escaping war and having
family members pass away from war.' On the surface, people look down on
me, thinking I'm spoiled and entitled. But the truth is, I've felt so
trapped, misunderstood, embarrassed, and repressed. Ironically, it's
come to a point where I've splurged in luxury and self-care (aka,
makeup, body treatments, and Chanel). I love glamming up and hitting the
bars/clubs and socialising with people. Nothing is more thrilling than
people telling me I look 'hot' and having guys and girls flirt with me.
(My family doesn't know I'm bisexual, and they're anti-LGBT). I've
always felt so insecure about my actual life, my working-class
background, my controlling parents, and loathe my body image. I'm
embarrassed about my excessive spending and budgeting struggles. I feel
so embarrassed that while my friends are getting married and becoming
parents, I'm the one still being parented. I'm still the one who has to
be followed around, check on, and have barely a say in my own financial
and other decisions. Just because they paid for my school, taxes and
fled war does not mean that they care about me. All I just want is to be
truly loved, and trusted. Hugs and kisses mean far more to me, than a
house they will give to me after they pass. I'm just too conflicted
right now. Much appreciated.

                    My 14 year old daughter has been diagnosed with depression, which has
worsened in last two months due to her bf of almost a year ending
relationship and blocking her on every platform. Her school reluctance
worsened last term and she started on medication which didn’t rectify
but certainly made her a little better. Sadly two weeks ago she met a
16yo boy who is telling her everything she wants to hear while giving
her access to drugs/alcohol. Two weeks ago, she didn’t return home after
shopping as planned and we had to get police involved as she’d switched
off her phone. We don’t know any of the kids she’s hanging out with as
they’re from 30-60 mins away from home and obviously in different
schools/years. The police went to meet daughter for welfare check and
she said she’s not coming home, my husband took her mobile from her in
frustration so we very reluctantly agreed to come home. After a week of
making up to us, we agreed for her to go shopping with a girlfriend 8am
Saturday morning. She did not return until 3.15pm the following day. We
were worried sick but this time she did tell us she was safe with
friends (turns out she was with bf). Police say there’s nothing can be
done as crime not committed! That we actually don’t know but bf has sent
me a photo of his bed with caption ‘who doin wat’. Husband said he’s
taunting us as he’s lied to us since start about even being with
daughter. Now her school friends have said she hanging with wrong crowd
and don’t want to be around her anymore, this is pushing her further
away and she’s now refusing to go to school. Both dad and I are at a
complete loss. We spend time together, ferry her to and from
work/school. She turns 15 next week and we always do something extra
special for birthdays., some people say take everything away, some
don’t. Police said taking her phone away won’t solve problem. It’s just
heartbreaking at a time she needs her friends, they’re backing off yet
some of them helped her deceive us about where she was anyway!

back, whenever i comfront her about anything she spins it around to find
a way to make herself the victim and I'm just done with her, but the
main thing for me is these feelings I've been feeling, i don't know how
to express them properly or talk to someone about this, lot's of people
here say to see a professional, but being a minor and all it's hard to
go to a professional alone with the case of my parent's having my
medicare details, I'm most afraid of coming out to my parents about this
because i don't know how they will react or if they'll even believe me.
I have reached out to a friend and he recommended me to reach out using
a hotline so i found this site and decided to share here and i thought i
might as well share, i just don't know what to do with these feelings
and how to manage it without making obvious changes in my life that
people will notice, I'm highly scared about how others will react to me
feeling these things, especially the change in how people act towards me
once they know I'm struggling like this, so it just feels right taking a
leap of faith and getting advice from others here anonymously.

                    Hello... My brother suffers from Schizophrenia and has been on a DSP
since returning to Australia in 2011 and on the UK version whilst
residing in the UK for the 15 years prior to this. He is mid 50's now
and still lives with my parents who moved to Ireland 12 months ago. My
mum contacted Centrelink to ask about the portability of both their aged
pensions and his DSP and was told that they would be able to continue.
What she wasn't told was he should have had a review before leaving in
order to 'secure' his DSP and after four weeks of leaving his pension
has been stopped. He has had nothing for the past year. He has never
worked and has never lived alone and in order to reinstate his pension
Centrelink have told him he needs to be re-assessed by a Dr in Ireland.
His new Dr advised my mum (who acts on his behlaf) that there is no way
he could provide the level of detail required to complete the
documentation. We appealed the centrelink decision which was
unsuccessful based upon the 4 week rule and I now have an Administrative
Appeal Tribunal hearing on Tuesday to challenge the decision again. If
this is unsuccessful which I fully expect it to be as they are only
focusing on the 4 week rule I'm wondering if I just have him fly back to
Australia.....re-apply which I would think would be accepted and then
once it's reinstated have him return to Ireland and his home with my
parents. It's brutal how they can cut someone off on a technicality and
provide no support around how to resolve a situation which is clearly
based on poor information and a minor oversight. No support provided and
I'm so angry. Just venting really and would be interested in anyone who
has had to reapply or had issue when moving overseas or with the AAT.
Thanks all.

                    This is a throw away account, as I'm embarrassed.I'm 32 years old, and I
don't have any friends, ambitions, and never had a relationship. As a
kid, I always felt like the black sheep of the family. Always feeling
like I'm in the shadows of my siblings. I had a very abusive mother
during my teen years, where I wasn't allowed out the house except for
going to school, wasn't allowed to have friends over, and never got to
experience dating. Everyday, I was told I was worthless, how nobody will
ever want to be near me, and my grandmother even wishing I committed
suicide. When I was finally old enough to get away, I felt I was thrown
into a world that I had no experience for. When I tried to meet people,
I was always targeted and felt unwelcomed. I was also constantly bullied
at my job. I attempted to do 2 activities I was very passionate about,
but eventually I was bullied out of those, with one of those involving
death threats and harassment. It was this harassment, that the few
friends I did make while at these places, no longer wanted anything to
do with me.Because of my very troubled upbringing, I am terrified with
meeting new people, especially women, as I don't want to be hurt again.
I've always been told that I wasn't good enough, that even if I did
manage to gain confidence, I still believe those words. My anxiety gets
so bad at times, that once another person gets aggressive with me, I
shut down. Very rarely in life have I felt I belonged. I always tried to
remember that old saying ""treat others how you want to be treated"" but I
don't get the same treatment that I share.There are more examples, but
long story short, I'm at that point where I don't know where I'm headed.
I want friends and a loving partner, but I'm afraid of people and find
it hard to trust people. I want to do those activities I loved before,
but scared about seeing those people again. When my anxiety and
depression happens, I really do feel like the words from my mother about
being alone forever and how worthless I am are actually true.

                    Hi I have just started feeling very low lately I don’t know why I have
no financial problems, some illness in family but have dealt with this
for a while. I feel just bland if that possible. I feel jittery as well.

                    Hi all, I really need to reach out and talk about the issues swirling
around in my head. I have had depression for two decades now. I am on
anti-depressents which cause me to not feel much emotion at all. I just
feel numb. I also have OCD, specifically contamination OCD. My brother
peed on his hands once and used our fridge and, after 10 years since it
happened I have been so scared to touch it with my bare hands that I
always wear gloves in my own kitchen. I have pure OCD where thoughts can
come in and I don't necessarily have to do a compulsion to try and get
rid of them. My thoughts involve incest which disgusts me but I can't
get rid of them and it scares me. I am very worried about my future. I
still live at home because of my mental health and want to move out, but
rent is so expensive I would have to live with someone who I don't know.
Plus I am incontinent. This I'm sure has been caused by my depression
but who's to say. The urologists I've seen haven't been able to help.
I'm in a job I do well but I don't like. I don't know how to move into a
different role or what I would even do. I just feel stuck. I am unhappy
in my social life. I have barely any friends. I have never had a real
loving relationship. I am afraid I am unlovable in my current condition,
or if I am even able to love someone else with my depression and lack of
feeling emotion. I need some guidance. I don't know how I can change my
life. It feels like too many issues on top of each other which I have
battled for decades that hasn't gotten any better. I have seen
psychologists before with very limited success. I find it very hard to
see things through with them and I don't know why. Do I not want to get
better? Am I just so used to suffering? I'm so confused. Thanks for
listening.

                    Hey everyone,I have had mental health issues (anxiety, then OCD, then
depression) since 2021. I have been on anti-depressants since Oct 2023.
I was getting better but am having a couple of lows. Why is it taking so
long to feel better? Why is this still happening to me? (sidenote- I
also know sleeps really important, excerside and eating well but I just

                    Lately, I have been feeling so many feelings at once, i can't keep up
anymore. from being depressed, to being anxious, to feeling so lonely
that I can't even handle it anymore. and now the guilt that I have now
relapsed. I cry every day, struggle to get out of bed in the morning, i
need to talk to people but I have no one to talk to. So as a result of
everything, i'm just sufficating in my own life, my own body. and I feel
there is nothing i can do too help myself.This is not my first rodeo,
but for some reason it just never gets easier. no one understands me, or
cares or takes the time to really know how I am feeling, so I just give
up, I don't even care anymore.I am the friend that is always happy,
laughing, cheerful and I am always there for everyone, i really care for
those I love, and I alway make sure my friends are okay. but then I sit
back and think, who makes sure I am okay? who is caring about me?
because only 2 people know that I am not the happy and cheerful person
that I put on display.

                    I keep a sort of digital journal on my phone to keep track of how I feel
over the years, and recently i’ve been going through the entries. It
seems like every year around this time (winter), I get more depressed
than usual. I think it might be seasonal depression, but I don’t know
whether to bring this up to my mum yet before I know more about it. Are
there any good learning resources about seasonal depression I could look
into (or any other people that can relate)?

                    Hi, first time every reaching out on BB. I have struggled with
depression for as long as I can remember that is more the 40 years. The
last 4 years have been hectic. Death of my mum, uncle, and grandmother
all in 12 months. And nothing simple all very complicated. Work has
changed and is making me crazier than ever. And then on the weekend
something dark came out of me after a few drinks, I attacked a person. I
fully snapped! This I have no excuse for but I cant understand how I
could do this to another person. Its now started the spiral of dark
thoughts. I have a loving family and all the good stuff in life, why is
this becoming so ugly now? I don't understand and I don't know how my
friends and family can ever forgive me on attacking another woman. Has
anyone out there snapped like this, I am a grown women who attacked
another women in a bar.

                    I'm not sure why I'm here and posting this now, it's almost 4 years
later... I feel like I was let down by my psychologist, because I really
spiralled under her care. I had seen my psychologist for some time back
in 2018 as I was suffering chronic fatigue and she helped me work
through the depression and stress and anxiety I dealt with in
association with the illness I was suffering, work stress and financial
stress from going part time. I got myself back to a good place through
CBT and her care. But I later got pregnant and then right after the
birth of my child I felt my emotions and mental health were extra
fragile with all that was going on for me, so I made sure to get my
mental health care plan up to date and was seeing my psychologist
regularly. Thing is, I actually sank into pretty awful post natal
depression, but my psychologist didn't pick it up, my GP did. I still
remember the shock on her face the following sessions... She had no
idea. I ended up going on antidepressants on advice of my GP, and I
can't really explain the dark dark place I sank into, but I am much
better now. I just still carry this disappointment that I had been
seeing my psychologist as I knew I was more vulnerable, and she still
missed it. Not sure if anyone will read this but thanks for listening if
so. I think the problem is that she has shaken my trust in psychologists
and now and then I find myself slipping a bit and want to see someone
but I can't trust anyone. Does that make sense?

                    The last few weeks I have been suffering. I was hired for a job to
become a manager, I was made to bring in new procedures and get the
place running better before I was announced. It was something I worked
hard for only to be deceived by the area manager. He promised 3 people
the role and then gave it to someone completely different. I took it
hard and found it hard to go into work for a couple of days. One day I
got half way there, felt really bad and had to turn around and go home
again. On my return to work he fired me with some excuse. I was one of
the hardest working staff there and always did a great job and got lots
of reviews. So I lost my job. Spent a couple of days unable to get out
of bed. Now struggling to find a new job, I've always been employable
and a great hard worker and it's really kicking me in the guts doing all
these applications for no calls. Now I am worrying about finances. My
girlfriend was supportive and got me feeling positive but now our
relationship is failing. At the start of the year I packed up, moved all
my things and sold off my appliances to get a place together. We were
living 1.5hrs apart. I sacrificed, changed from my stable job to one
that now screwed me over, moved to her area to make things easier and
now that is falling apart because she is unhappy I have boxes stored in
our garage that I haven't sorted and she wants it tidy. She knows I have
been through a horrible few weeks. But now putting more strain on me
while I am already down. I have no money to move and get my own place,
won't get a lease without work and I have no appliances any more. I feel
like I have nothing left and no value or self worth. I don't know why it
annoys me that we are having issues and she just goes to sleep so easy
while I am awake at 3am crying because my life is going nowhere.

                    Hi, and thanks for reading. My wife and I love each other very much, we
often hold hands and kiss etc, but since she became pregnant and gave
birth to our son her libido has practically vanished. Our son turns 3 in
a few weeks and it is a hard reality to confront, but it has been years
since she has been excited about getting intimate. She tells me daily
that she is the luckiest woman, and I know how much she loves me (with
all her heart), and I absolutely adore her, but when it comes to the
bedroom, it's all very one sided. We are intimate on occasion, 5 or 6
times in the last 12 months, but I know she is just doing it for me and
it doesn't have the emotional connection I would love. We've talked
about it, but when we do I can tell she feels very guilty, and that's
the last thing I want! She was diagnosed with depression and anxiety 4-5
years ago, and has regular counselling, and I know she has body image
issues (I find her very attractive but she doesn't find herself
attractive), I know that these are likely what are causing her low
libido, but I really don't know what to do. She would love to want more
sex, but I don't know if that is for my sake or hers at this point.
We've done work together on love languages and I've focused on showing
her love in ways that she likes the best, and she does the same, there's
just this one snag and it gets me down even though I know why it's
happening. People comment on how they wish they had a loving
relationship like ours, I know that there's no perfect relationship, but
it is hard to feel loved, and yet so unloved as well. I know that
mismatched libido is not uncommon, but I feel that ours is quite
extreme. I'm not really sure what the purpose of my post is actually, I
don't think that there are any easy fixes, I guess I want to put this
out there to let other people know that if they're going through
something similar, they're not alone. If anyone has any thoughts I'd
love to hear them (sorry for the essay).

                    Hello, I am a 14 (turning 15 later on in the year) year old girl who was
diagnosed with ADD (inattentive ADHD) and level 2 autism probably about
a year ago. Recently, a psychologist had me do a questionnaire and when
they got the results back, they told my mum that my answers showed I
could clinical depression. Honestly, I wasn’t too surprised, because
ever since the start of high school I have noticed my mood changing as
well as developing a ‘procrastination monster’ who stops me nearly
everyday from doing stuff from basic chores to having a quick, easy
shower. I think year 8 was the start of most of it: My attendance
started to get really bad because I would jump right into bed after
school, never get out, wake up in the morning realising I wasn’t ready,
then miss the bus. Neither my poor mum or myself could tell if I had a
serious problem or if I was just super lazy. Now that I’m in year 9, I
feel like I’m always moody, causing everyone to get stressed out and
then upset at me. When it gets bad, I often get thoughts of how nice it
would be for everyone if I disappeared: Mum would no longer have a
dramatic, sulky daughter, my sister would spend 80% less time having to
fight with an annoying older sister, and everyone would have a whole lot
less stressing out to do. I also don’t feel okay with my body. I stress
eat, or just eat when I’m bored. When I get lollies, I try to eat a few,
then end up eating the whole packet. When I feel gross, I desperately
want to exercise but the singular though drains me, just like mum asking
me to do the dishes. Why do I make it such a big deal? She spends all
her time at work just to afford food for my sister and I can’t even get
myself to do the dishes.. What kind of daughter am I? Part of me really
wants to help her, but it’s like there’s a weight that keeps me down on
the couch or in bed. Someone tell me, am I depressed? Am I
procrastinating? Is this just a symptom of ADD? Or am I just lazy? I
want to be able to save myself before I become so unbothered that I quit
all my favourite sports and never see anyone again. I don’t want to, but
I could stop taking care of myself entirely and disintegrate by decaying
in my own filth for too long. I think I amheading in that direction.
Someone please let me know if you have ever felt this way, because I
feel so selfish and stupid.

                    I have been suffering from depression since Feb, I have tired 2
medication and there has been complications with both of them, the first
one saved me back in 2020 when I had a physical and mental breakdown.
Everything goes back a difficult marriage which I have stayed in for
years. Which we couldn't have children and tonnes of fertility treatment
and crazy amounts of verbal and physical violence to a point I cracked
after a bad back injury and 18 mouths of hell happened I was on a
certain medication for months and didn't know what happening. I ended up
at my parents in bed crying all day and not knowing anything, then I
found a doctor that helped me who was train shrink and naturopathy and
she save me. Then 3 years later after being normal and off medication
for 18 months. I hurt my back again and flood of anxiety came and all
the problems started with the meds and not before long the depression
set in and marriage I rebuilt collapsed again and I'm back at my elderly
parents again off work for last month and not sure what to. Not on any
meds. Barely coping and maybe trying a third medication or maybe doing
tms treatment or going into a treatment clinic. My life is a mess always
crying and now have zero energy. That probably on half what happened in
the last 15 years with marriage and mental health. I just had to get
that off my chest. Thank you

                    I'm going crazy at the moment: My job sucks so much, I can never save
enough for my own home in the future. What are we actually working for?
To survive? Why survive a life when we never have time to live. I just
want a house with a garden to have loads of pets, at least then I can
work to support them. Now, I'm renting and not allowed to have pets
anywhere, it stresses me out and I have nothing to look forward to in
the future. I'm so sick of taking it day by day at the moment, when I'm
at work I would rather paint or do crafts, something that gives meaning
to myself, but I'm so sick of lowering my bar to find a little sliver of
something in the day to day to keep going. It all sounds like excuses to
me to keep going and it's all not good enough anymore for me.

quite a while now. i am in my last year of high school and i really need

to my parents about it. they are also very expensive and i think there
is a long waitlist. i have a councillor at school, but i don’t really

                    As I sit here at my laptop I ponder where to start and if this is just a
cry out for attention, I'm just a bit lost. Hello my name is David, I am
a gay male, I work as a mechanic/technician and have been for now, just
over 10 years. Due to the toxic and hostile nature of the industry and
trades it made it hard to be open about myself, I made the mistake of
never coming out, being true to myself and open with everyone. As time
went on, I could tell, even though there are nice people I work with, I
had to ""play"" along (playing ""straight""), come up with excuses or fake
stories if there was any questions I had to be quick thinking. This has
not put me in a great position as I've formed some friendships at work
over the years and no one really knows. Sad thing is, I need to get out
of the trade, at least out of this job. The stress and anxiety I
experience actually makes me sick in the morning and i go into a blank
frozen zone in my mind and just shake/panic attack, luckily I'm on meds
that help with that. This is already pretty full on, add to that I've
been suffering depression since probably early 2010's, ups and downs and
the downs have been gradually getting worse. I have a partner which I
proposed to in Japan last year when we were on holiday with friends,
that was a special time of my life (I really wanna go back to Japan too
haha). Add more to the mix of my messed up mind, I have issues a bit
with his weight only because it turned me off during you know what time.
And it really annoys me and makes me sad when i realise this. It's
something I can't help, like a natural impulse thing it's hard to
describe. He's working out, swimming, going for walks, getting a better
job and I couldn't be any more proud of him and I love him so much.
Sadly we haven't made love in probably years, I'm not kidding. It
actually hurts me that my mind just doesn't feel like it (anyone had
this?) I feel like I'm hurting him like I don't love him but it's not
true.. I have fear of getting older tied up with being a failure and
also a strong fear of change, finding a better job and new people etc. I
also haven't had good luck with any psychologist in the past, could be I
just haven't got the one that ""clicks"" with me but even to my own mind I
feel extremely complicated and it's stupid and actually pisses me off.
Sometimes I really want to escape it all, like spiderman no way home,
have nearly everyone forget i ever existed and start again.

common theme. I've never been able to articulate what loneliness means
to me until I read this quote: ""The story loneliness is much longer than
the story of life. In the sense of what most people mean by living.
Without children or partner, without meaningful family or a home, a day
can last an eternity: a life without those things is a life without a
story, a life in which there is nothing - no narrative dramas - to
alleviate the cruelly meticulous passing of time.The lack of tenderness
or intimacy, loneliness is when nothing will stick to you,, when nothing
will thrive around you, when you start to think that you kill things
just by being there.""

                    Hey for anyone who is reading this I'm turning 18 this year. I have been
diagnosed with autism, ADHD and depression since I was three years old.
I took medication since was three for the past 15 years of my childhood
life. I didn't notice these symptoms, well to explain it further they
didn't bother me as much, but my parents have suffered a ton of shit
from me when I was little, tantrums, excessive crying, and many more.
but apart from that I was the happiest I had ever been, so much joy that
I never felt sadness. As I grew older, at the age of 13-15 when my body
began to develop into a woman, hormonal emotions were coming out (which
was completely normal at the time) some days I would feel sad, angry,
tired and helpless. and when I got my first period I experienced typical
teenage mood swings, but as you know when a cycle is done those mood
swings tend to settle. However, my 'emotions' wouldn't go away, instead
they would grow stronger and develop bigger until I got so used to them
that it just ended up being normal. my parents questioned me if I was
bipolar or something because I had insanely crazy mood swings every five
seconds, but I just told them 'I was tired and its normal..' years go
by, and i'm age 16, I start to notice something different about myself,
something that I don't recognise anymore. It started small, like with
the crazy outburst of emotions, but then it lead to other things like;
not enjoying what I used to enjoy...for me it was (videogames) and even
when I tried to force myself into playing them, I didn't feel the
satisfaction that I used to when I played them. it wasn't just
videogames it was all my hobbies everything that defined who I was. it
soon came that I grew to a lack of motivation I didn't feel like
completing any daily activities that I used to do, I didn't feel like
moving an inch from my bed I just wanted to sleep and escape reality and
I didn't know why, by this I was angry and upset and confused. life
wasn't living for me and it still isn't now.. the worst part is I can't
figure out if this is just a normal teenage experience or heavy symptoms
of depression. and how do i fix this... how do i fix myself? how do I
just be normally happy?

was asexual and left it at that. i dont really mentally understand
intimacy? but a year ago i made friends with this amazing girl from the

both care about each other a great deal, it didnt get romantic but
honestly neither brought it up or cared we just hung out heaps and
enjoyed life, it was the happiest period of my life by a gigantic
margin. well her visa expired and she moved back to the states. I have
cried every day for a month now, and while we text daily its just not
helping to remove the pain at all... i need her in my life. i feel
hollow like a peice of me is missing and i cant get her out of my head
at all, im obsessed with seeing her again. is that love? ive never felt
it before.Am i depressed if im crying every day? I dont know if i should
tell her how much she means to me now that we are so far apart but at
this point im just really scared and just need another person to give me
an opinion on what to do. i dont have any scary thoughts, but the
sadness i live with at every moment is unbearable. thank you so much for
listening,Roman.

anxious if my baby is okay which gets draining for me and my husband

                    Recently I've been struggling with my sister and our relationship. Since
her wedding at the start of the year, she has brought up issues with me.
These issues came like an avalanche, without warning, and have derived
from issues which I had believed, were already solved. She has recently
given me an ultimatum, that I need to act according to her wishes, or I
will miss out on some of her events in the future. I feel as though my
sister doesn't want to understand me, or listen to what I have to say,
or even being open minded. It feels like a helpless situation. We live
in different states and a lot of our previous communication has occurred
via text or phone calls. I don't want to communicate via text anymore
because what I'm trying to say always ends up getting misinterpreted. We
are in gridlock at the moment.These past few months, I've been trying to
not think about it too much but underneath it all, I'm mourning the loss
of our previously close relationship. My sister is not in my inner
circle and I'm not in hers and this makes me feel sad. This conflict has
also impacted my other siblings and I feel guilty about this, as I never
wanted this conflict in the first place, or for it to impact anyone
else. At this stage, I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel and
I'm hurting.

                    Hi, I’m a 57 year old male. I came from an abusive step family
relationship and ran away from home at 15. I ended up being homeless and
drifted from shelter to shelter, state to state and couldn’t keep a job
or make friends. This lasted about 8 years. Fast forward 30 plus years
and I have a beautiful Wife, a lovely home,a good job and plenty of
money. So many trigger points remind me of my past and it depresses me
severely. As I get older it seems to get worse. I see homeless people on
the streets and it breaks my heart as I have been there. I try to ignore
the trigger points but they are so raw and overwhelming. I should be
happy for the fortunate position I’m in now, but my past is a huge
roadblock. Sometimes I wonder if going back to my past ways would ease
the pain.

                    I have been with my husband for 34 years and recently he has told myself
and our kids that he has had depression for the past 4 years, brought on
by a childhood trauma. The reason it came out was because he felt bad
about telling me a lie, which he then told me the truth and what he's
been going through. He has been speaking with a counsellor over the
phone through work, but he said he feels they are talking from a card.
He has seen his GP and is now waiting on an appt with a local
Psychologist who I found that deals with Trauma/PTSD.For the past few
years I have felt a shift or a difference in his and our relationship
but thought I was causing it all because my Peri Menopause has coincided
with his past 4 years of depression.He has moved out of our bedroom as
he needs his own space and he gets up and down a lot in the night due to
nightmares and permanent nightshift worker at the mines.I feel I no
longer know how to be around him or even just chat with him, because it
seems he doesn't want anything to do with me. And I'm worried I will
upset him.He said he can't talk to me about how's he feeling, and I
think he knows that it might upset me.I have gone from phonecalls or
texts every day to absolutely nothing and don't know if I should be
contacting him just to check-in or what.The only time he seems to talk
to me is when he talks about going to Thailand next year for 2 months by
himself. As he thinks he needs to step out of his comfort zone and go
somewhere to be by himself where no-one knows him. I am just completely
lost and don't know where I am with him anymore. I keep reminding myself
it's not me it's what's going on in his head but it's hard not to take
things personally and I'm sick of getting upset all the time.xx

                    I was working full time enjoying life until workplace bullying led to
major depressive disorder and anxiety. I had tried to do some work but
the impact on my mental health was significant. After even a 1 hour
consult with a client, I’d be in bed, unable to face the world just
wanting to sleep sometimes for days. Keeping up my role as father and
husband has been severely affected. I’ve now ceased all work and this
did provide an improvement in my mental health but it was short lived. I
am now in a low mood, doing only the necessities of life and spending my
time in bed. I feel paralysed. I can’t seem to move forward. The only
thing I look forward to is bed time, and that is a challenge given my
struggles trying to sleep. On the nights I have a sleeping tablet it’s
great. The noise and self hatred stops until I wake up. I don’t know
what more to do.

that’s actually helped, even if a little? I’ve always struggled a bit
with self esteem and avoiding things too. In high school I became very
depressed for the first time and lost all my interests, and never really
recovered. I’m 30 now and I feel like a shell of a person, like I don’t
have any strengths or ideas or value. I don’t really know who I am or
what I want. I don’t feel happy, I just scrape by everyday. At the same
time, I think I do have an idea of what I want or what I think I do but
I just maybe haven’t let myself stop and think about it let alone try
achieve it. Like having a partner and a family. I’ve never been in a
proper relationship, I would never let it progress to that. I’ve barely
dated anyone. Just as I’ve started to explore that more I’ve learned I
have premature menopause and I’m likely infertile. I’m finding it so
upsetting and triggering of these feelings, like of course I am I always
knew I’d be alone because I’m defective and unlovable. I know that’s not
logical but I can’t help but believe it and it keeps coming up. I feel
so sad and lonely, none of my friends or family understand. It was so
hard to even get my doctors to me seriously. And when I have opened up

I had many friends and was quite social, but now it feels like no one

feel jealous when my husband gets invited to hang out with the boys or
go to the pub after work, while I'm stuck at home with the kids because
no one wants to hang out with me. I feel like there's no point in living
if I have no friends. The only reason I haven't done anything is because
of my kids. I constantly think about them and how they would have no mum
around anymore. I pretty much stay at home by myself with nothing to do
and no one to talk to. My husband works crazy hours and is hardly ever
home. My eldest is 14 and is never home, and my youngest is nearly 10,

married and my wife was fantastic through this period of my life we got
through it and life’s rolled on with our two kids who are now grown up.
At age 61 in and late 2022 my mum passed away and in December of that
year I began to transition to retirement in Jan 2023 my wife said she
wanted to leave me. For me this was out of the blue and gutted me still
does. A few weeks after the announcement I found out she was cheating on
me since early 2022. It’s totally gutted me and made me feel ashamed and
worthless as a man and person for that matter. I haven’t been in contact
with her since this time and our financial settlement is completed . So
today I’m feeling low and I see an email from her requesting divorce
proceedings. This has hit me hard and I wounded if I will ever get over
it. I have had counciling and was told I still have PTSD from 2000s
accident and combined with the death of my mother, retirement and wife
leaving me was depressed. Anyway the councillor didn’t work out. In mid
2023 I returned to work and have engrossed myself in my work. I have no
external interest and work is my life and I’m good at what I do. Anyway
today I receive an email for divorce proceedings and it’s hit me hard
and I’m struggling to cope. At 63 I feel like I should be able to cope
and be big enough to move on like my ex but I just can’t seem to.

                    Me and my finance have been together for 5 years. We share two beautiful
children of our own and I have a child from a previous relationship. I'm
lacking an emotional connection with my fiance. He's grown up in a
really difficult situation, this makes him block out his emotions
because that's what he learned to do to cope. I'm a highly emotional,
empathetic person. I like to talk about how I feel and this seems to be
overwhelming to him which ends in a fight and him walking away/blocking
me out. The thing that kills me the most is that he could easily walk
away from this relationship if he wanted to and I'd be an absolute
wreck. There's so many times I feel lonely, like I can't express myself
because I don't want it to end in a fight. I love this man so much and
when we are good we are really good. But I need more from him, I need
him to be more than surface level with me. I also resent him for
allowing me to be alone in my feelings, allowing me to sit there crying
while he just walks off to bed because he's had enough of the
conversation. I get people deal with things differently but he won't
even address the situation at a later date he just brushes it off. It
makes me feel unimportant and that my feelings aren't valid. it's
ruining me, I've booked in to see my gp tomorrow to hopefully get a

relationship can ever be fixed.

                    I’ve been suffering with this issue more than a year now but
unfortunately still couldn’t find an answer. I just had 8 sessions with
my previous psychologist. During 5th or 6th session I started to
develope romantic/erotic thoughts towards my psychologist. It was really
distressing and disturbing to manage my day to day life. These thoughts
were unwanted and irrational. So I raised it with my psychologist and I
thought she would help me with cope with it. Unfortunately she
terminated therapy. Then I felt rejected and abandoned by the person I
mostly trusted and I couldn’t tolerate it. I started to follow her home
after work, stalking her on social media and invading her privacy. I
knew it inappropriate, I didn’t want to scare her, I didn’t want to give
her stress full time, I didn’t want to harass or abuse her, I didn’t
mean anything but I couldn’t control my impulsive thoughts. In the end
she went to the court and applied an IVO against me. It was so shameful
for me so I didn’t want to go to court. I have had past attempts on my
life. After this episode I got pregnant with a baby boy . Unfortunately,
I could complete only 16 weeks. I had a miscarriage. It was
unbelievable, my baby was completely normal had a strong heart beat.
However, I had to give a birth to a dead baby. I am depressed again and
have thoughts towards my previous psychologist. I have urged to go and
see her but my hands are tight by the court order. The buildup pressure
drives me to suicidal thoughts again. I want to stop these cycles
happening again. I’m taking my medication but nothing helps. My
psychiatric discharged me to my GP during the suicidal episode. since
then no other psychiatrist accepts my referral. I haven’t seen a
psychiatrist for 6 months. I asked help from so-called mental health
professionals. No one helps me. I don’t know who to call, when I call
PTS, a nurse told me i’m too far from their hospital. I can’t go to my
nearest hospital as my husband works as a mental health nurse in there.
I had enough, I am so tired , but I have to live for my 3 year old
daughter. I want to know what’s wrong with me. My previous psychiatrist
diagnosed BPD last year. Can someone please help me and tell me what to
do and how to stop these cycle of episodes.

                    Growing up I didn't like my father because he wasn't ideal. He wasn't
involved, encouraging, praising and socially valuable, affectionate,
understanding and supportive. He never cared about me achieving my
driving, figuring out a life purpose and generally transitioning into a
adult. He was selfish, grandiose, and would talk behind your back and
think lies are nothing, if you don't know their being told. I also hate
his sister I had to know his friend for a little longer than a dozen
years when I was going through high school. I was bullied all during
high school and suffering everyday for six years since 2008 until 2013.
I hated everyone in the school. I had five extra years of bad
mistreating acquaintance toxic relationship's and that lasted until
2018. I haven't agreed with my mental health diagnosis that I had since
2012 - 2014 which was a result because of my mistakes. The
pharmaceuticals I've been involuntary enforced on are detrimental and I
had three years of weight gain, than it lead to some stretch marks and I
was compensating and hating against tablet nausea with the old meds. It
got even worse being diagnosed with pre diabetes in 2017 and than by
2020 I was having the cholecystectomy with my gallbladder being removed.
It's the most un luck that anyone would get, it's literally being
murdered with their treating, yet I'm obviously given no compensation,
no apologies, no voluntary rights since their a promised myth. I've been
destroyed. To make it worse I have this horrible reality of
spirituality, I CAN'T detach, it's connected to the shrinks I was forced
to see back in 2021 when I was demanded into having a admission into
hospital, despite telling them I was fine and not wanting to go, my
general practioner insisted and argued he felt concerned. I just am
constantly discriminated about my intelligence in numerous ways
internally and made to feel different in negative ways. I can't prove it
to anyone, I just know that it's mixed from the American's and my brief
hospital visit, I didn't like the psychologist and the psychiatrist I
had to experience during those four weeks. They invalidated me and were
cold, looking through me as a idiot and spoke to me like I was a child.
I told the doctor I didn't agree with my diagnosis. He extended my time
for two weeks and than I was on a 9 month community order to get a
monthly injection. They see me as a relapse and I was only a voluntary
forced admission, I didn't want to go. They generalise me too.

                    I recently have gotten much better mentally thanks to my psychologist,
my Auntie R and a person who talked to me once on YouTube. For a long
time I suffered from narcissism because for example, I use to want to be
the prettiest and most popular girl in school which I never was and now
realize that it doesn't matter. I also really wanted to have a daughter
one day and don't get me wrong because even when I was narcissistic, I
knew I would care about her needs and would love her no matter what
(children are so lovely and it would be extremely hard not to love your
own child especially), but one of the reasons why I wanted a daughter
back then was quite frankly (I feel really bad saying this) to live
through her. I was hoping that she would be the ""prettiest"" and most
popular girl in school because I never was and I was also hoping that
she would be an extremely nice person because even then, I knew I wasn't
that nice (I tried really hard to be nice because it makes people feel
good and because I want to be a really nice person or at least a nice
person but I wasn't very good at it most of the time), but that wouldn't
be fair for my daughter and it wouldn't be fair to my son if I had one
as well for that matter. I also found it extremely hard to listen to
people, to take accountability, etc. People also say that I am lying
about not remembering things that I have said and done, but I genuinely
don't remember a lot of the mean things I have said about people. I have
asked them to please talk to me about it in a *direct* way so I know
what I said, but they only either talk to me about it in an indirect way
or they would talk to people pretending to be me online about it (a lot
of people have pretended to be me online) and there for it doesn't get
through to me. The people I have mentioned earlier helped me get over my
narcissism because they reminded me that even when I was unwell that I
do have some things that are really good about me (everyone has things
that are really good them) and they very politely encouraged me to work
on my weaknesses as well as remembering that I have a lot of strengths
as well. The person on Youtube told me about shadow work and about how
we all have things that are good and bad about us and that even if you
have this disorder, you still have good things about you and you can
always work on the bad things about you. (He said it in a really nice
way too). I would just like some more *kind* advice to help me improve
more and more........

question that I suffer from chronic pain. In my entire body, specially
in feet, heels, knees, lower back, as I am a amputee. I have a problem
in my right hand too, doctors suspect carpal tunnel. As long as I don't
do anything, it's okay. But if I do something, it's painful. For which I
was on pain medication. So as I have a addiction too, is doing a opioid
replacement therapy. And did nothing for pain management, as I am
thinking about stopping opioid replacement therapy. I will have to deal
with pain. Which was somehow numbed because of the medication I use for
addiction. On top of that I have a mental illness too, if I speak to a
doctor. What they say is, reasonable help. They can give me, so it's
really a struggle. How you can recover if you are in agony from pain.
Doctor gives you nothing for pain. And the antibiotics you use gives you
a tremors and extrapyramidal side effects. The support network you have,
has a different agenda. Which they are kept on hiding and kept on
pursuing there motives. How to deal with all that

nothing quietens the bloody people that live around me. I despise
staying home, my parents and I do not have a good relationship and being

                    I've had a tough few years and think I have trauma that keeps coming up
for me from what ive been through. As a quick summary without writing a
huge essay the below traumas I'm trying to deal with: PTSD & PND from
first born son (2016)2nd baby was diagnosed with down syndrome and 25%
survival so I had a medical termination as 13 weeksBrain tumor (size of
a golf ball) in 2020 and rushed into brain surgery, tumor was not
cancerous but have regular checkups17 year marriage, cohesion control
(2022) managed to claw my way out of the marriage to leaveNo family
support in Australia all family in UK Mother in law and I got into an
argument over her filming me whilst on a kids pickup, and I ended up
being arrested for intimidation and went to court. (Never been in
trouble with the police before) I was totally distraught by how the
police treated me as the perpetrator. Suicidal and ended up in
emergencyMy best friend suddenly died at 39 years old in 2023The same
day I went to court I fell over afterwards and broke my ankle in 2
places and dislocated it, and had surgerySon was diagnosed with ADHD and
mild intellectual disability in 2023I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2023
How do you deal with it all, most psychologist in my opinion are not
good, mainly young and have no idea. feeling helpless and hopeless even
though my everyday life is not bad at all, actually better than its been
for years but these trauma's change you as a person.

                    I’m not sure if anyone will see this or know how to help but I turned 19
a month ago and since then I’ve been struggling mentally. First it was
about my career and what I want to do for the rest of my life and I
spiralled into panic attack after panic attack. I finished my semester
at uni and felt relief for a few days until I realised that I’m not
ready to be independent and I’m aging so fast and I’m wasting time. I
just can’t get a moment of peace and I’m worried that I’ll be like this
forever, I don’t know why I’m not happy anymore.

                    Hello, This is my first post on this platform- I am not used to reaching
out and talking about issues. I've always been the type to deal with it
by myself, mostly by distractions or suppressing it until it either goes
away or comes out in a big gush. In April I ruptured my ACL playing
soccer- something I have played for the better part of 15 years. I am in
an U20s squad, and was beginning to get senior games and recognition
when it happened doing something I've done millions of times before-
changing direction. I still dream about it and get flashbacks. 3 weeks
ago I had my ACL reconstruction. After the pain I experienced in the
first week - I thought that would be the worst of it, but the mental
side of it has hit me like a truck- especially at nights. It feels like
a part of my identity is gone, and I'm struggling to see the light at
the end of this 12 month tunnel back to soccer. I have nowhere to
express my emotion or escape reality and am stuck in a cycle of avoid
and ignore until night time where I inevitably break down. I have so
much support, I just don't want to burden them with the same rubbish. I
know I can't change it, and it's not worth dwelling over but I can't
help it. I keep asking ""why me?"". I was hoping for someone who
understands this mental toll- and who could maybe help me. I've been
told 'it gets better' and 'you'll come back stronger', but it all sounds
like words so early into this struggle. If anyone can share insight into
their experience, or give strategies to keep myself positive I would be
so grateful. Thank you.

                    I live with my mum. I'm 47, she's 77. She's a widow and I'm on a DSP for
reasons that I won't go into. She's incredibly depressed after losing
her husband (dad) over 8 years ago. I have terrible days too. There are
days where she bottles up her emotions and then explodes like a volcano.
It usually takes half hour of arguing to peel back the layers to
discover the reason. Sometimes it's her reluctance to accept ageing.
Often it's her loneliness, especially considering we never see my
brother's family (3 grandkids and wife who no longer talks to us). She
has a heart of gold and wants to save the world, but can't help herself
with her own depression. We even had Legacy ring the other day and she
brushed them off. She's lonely, sits at home all day and reads books,
but never wants to go out. How do others cope? I have offered to take
her to libraries, to cafes, to lunch, etc. Nothing. She frets about
going to the hairdresser. We're both still grieving the loss of my dad,
but our depression seems to feed each other. I have a woodworking hobby
and that gets me out of the mindset, but is it even possible to help
loved ones like this? I often don't realise how depressed I am in this
environment until I go out and talk to someone my own age. How do other
""carers"" cope with watching someone deteriorate so much, given that she
used to be so happy?

                    Hi everyone and thankyou in advance for reading my post.For the past 2
years I have been battling severe depression. I feel completely numb. I
have isolated myself from pretty much every relationship I had, except
for my boyfriend who has been extremely supportive.I feel only negative
emotions, and cannot remember the last time I’ve been happy or
excited.However I have a great life. I have a loving stable family, a
stable job I enjoy, I love my boyfriend of 5 years, a decent amount of
savings, I’m in great health and have a trip to New York booked for
Christmas with my partner. I can appreciate all these things in my life,
however I am still depressed. In turn, I feel guilty for my depression.
I am 28 years old and my partner and I have been struggling with having
our first home built. It has taken 3 years so far and is only half way
built. The process has completely drained me, as I feel like my life
isn’t moving forward because of it.we both still live at home with our
parents, and I am absolutely miserable about it. And I feel guilty about
that too because my parents have helped me.I definitely feel like this
is the reason I’m feeling this way, however I also feel guilty and
ungrateful for my life. i am so confused, and in my spare time I just
lay in my bed and cry. not sure what I’m looking for here, but I come
from a family who doesn’t share their feelings.i have grown up being the
“overly sensitive” one, and whenever I voice my feelings about anything,
I am shut down and told that I am causing too much drama. thank you for

                    I'm looking for some help supporting my extremely depressed brother. He
is 25 years old and has struggled with his mental health his whole life.
He lives at home with our mother and myself, and he finds it difficult
to do normal things everyday. Examples of this include being out all
night and sleeping all day, starting fights over very small things (he
yelled at me for having a light on during the day), has no interest and
does not participate in work or study, doesnt shower and doesnt eat. He
has been like this for approx 18 months. He wont accept help from family
or friends and wont agree to take medication or seek professional help.
This is effecting our family as it is currently the responsibility of me
and my mum to support him however we can, but it is extremely draining
for us emotionally. I'm looking for anyone who can offer advice, support
or suggest someone who I can reach out to as I genuinely dont know what
else I can do to help him. Thank you!

                    Hi, I just wanted to rant about how I’ve been feeling & hopefully gain
some advice or make others feel less alone. I’m in my senior year of
high school atm and have been living alone for two years now. I achieve
good marks but find I regularly lose motivation for study because of my
depression, eating disorder and often feel confused about my future. My
most common feeling is loneliness. I have no friends at school or in my
personal life so when I come home from school, I am alone & cope with
these feelings through severe binge eating. This has become a daily
routine of coming home and eating until I physically feel uncomfortable.
Because of this, I have gained a bit of weight and struggle with body
dysmorphia. It’s very hard to go out when I feel I don’t look my best
because I place a lot of my worth of the way I look. I feel whenever
people are looking at me, they are judging me, which causes me to
isolate myself from the world. This usually results in major depressive
episodes consisting of self harm and suicidal thoughts. I find when I
feel sad, it’s an excruciating pain throughout my body and I become very
desperate to get rid of these feelings (hence the binging). I am seeking
professional help and about to start anti depressants for the first time
in a couple years, I really hope they help. Thanks for listening:)

                    I just use the sentences in the daily life is all right? To introduce
myself, I am a student which came from an international school that
studied easy knowledges in China. When Melbourne Uni gave me this offer,
I was very pleasant and feeling very anticipate to this school's life.
But the life changed in the study period in Australia. An unlucky and
unexperienced thing that I met was I were struggled with the scam.
During this time, I was trapped and controlled by Chinese which was the
same country and I doubted myself very much after this thing. It was
like a terrible crack down for me and several weeks later was the final
week and I did nothing in the scam in this seven week and I cried a lot.
It was the most awful experience that I met in Melbourne but this thing
can be blamed just of myself. So I failed lots of subjects and I don't
adapt the life in Australia neither.Then after this bad thing happen, I
decided to study in Summer term that rely on myself and I nearly have
nobody to talk about my life so I feel isolated from others a bit of
time, just the originally friends and parents. But this was a small
thing to me .The time right now that I wrote is I just found my interest
in subject not in my high school so doing some subjects that I dislike
is a very suffered thing to me. So when I studied the building class
which introduces lots of information in construction industry not the
mathematics one, I feel anxiety and cannot pay attention in it. The most
depression feeling is I found myself cannot do a successful subject
throughout my hardworking. The only thing that I can do right now is to
wait for my failing another subjects in the second or third semester and
I can do nothing with it. I feel very nervous about the study and I want
to get a good grade but I cannot do this so it is like I feel I am very
depress right know when I am typing this words.

                    Around 6 months ago I wrote here in a very, very distressed state. I had
no real support otherwise in real time. Its hard to write about myself
as i have alot of shame and almost non- existent self esteem esp atm. Im
41, female who has never really left home and had traumas at a young
adult age with little support other than home alone with my animals and
the very nice environment we were living in. 5 acres around farmland
just outside our costal tourist town.I had my big chicken house that
looked like a giant cubby. I had the pleasure of having ducks, a turkey,
chickens and lots of roosters, two sheep, and more. On complete rain
water and out away from pollution in the fresh air, quiet away from any
cars, very secluded and with a very nice view. Id lived there with my
parents for 26 years, since i was 14. I have social phobia/ GAD and
complex parents -mum with hearing disabilities and who can be very
dominant and quiet and dictating at times. Ive always tried to help
myself and at times been on a roll, but i’ve always had my environment
to be my calm go-to, part of my spirituality and support for myself, my
foundation, my calmness and basically a romance with the place. Nearly 6
months ago, dad declared we were moving asap because he wanted to invest
money for my sister to get a house. It was a complete shock and
distress. It was out of the blue with no warning and with no emotional
care at all. 2-3 months asap in dead winter to find a house to buy and
live by selling my everything place. It was irrational and made a
prolonged distress for me having to be yelled at for being upset and
having to be just me and dad moving everything. I told him i was feeling
suicidal and he threw stuff at my face. It was stressful times but I was
incredibly mentally unwell in a very bad way, continuing to push myself
for everyone with no support. By the time we moved and i had my own time
to myself, I severely broke down. I couldnt sleep, I was in severe shock
and emotional distress and on my iwn with it, my mum didnt want to know.
I had to ring the hospital for some support at some point.My days for
months was pushing myself if i had to drive my parents anywhere and
taking my dog for a walk, and then in bed so distraught and crying in so
much emotional pain it hurt so much. Its now nearly 6 months later and
ive come a long way from where i was emotionally, ive settled in more. I
see a psychologist and counselling. I push myself everyday.I get
creative with clay and gardening. Try to improve the house. But at the
end of the day, im still so upset i dont have my sanctuary, half my
animals, were in a built up urban area, i hate the backyard and the dark
house,I feel so hopeless- the things i loved are all gone, and altho i
practice radical acceptance and try to improve things- i still hate it.
I love country valleys, fresh air, gumtrees bushland, away from urban, i
love a sunny north facing house and farm animals. I wash myself with a
bucket of rainwater boiled rather than use the horrible tap water that
gives me rashes, i go outside for a drive and walk the dog to be in the
sun, i plant a garden to try and improve the backyard which is slabs of
concrete and a hills hoist. But at least there room for my chooks. What
weve gone from to here because of dads irrational choices is hard to
swallow. Our lifestyle has changed. My health has gone downhill mentally
and physically. I know in my bones what i need and want in life. My
sanctuary was my everything. Now when i go out, im severely depressed
and severely lacking in self esteem and have somewhat self neglect. And
esp at home. Its an added depression ontop of the depression i had b4
the move. I feel like ive lost my compass, ive lost my value and who i
am since weve moved and i feel hopeless in ever being able to get what i
want in life which is a sanctuary of my own. I feel heartbroken and not
home here. I hate living urban so much, but i push myself everyday, but
i know its just not me.

                    It's a complicated scenario but I've been wrongly diagnosed with
schizophrenia and I've been stuck under psychiatry for the last twelve
years. I have to have consultations every six months that I don't want
to have. I have to constantly get scripts and go every month to the
chemist and buy un wanted medication. I have to have medical
certificates and possibly occupational assessments just to legally drive
a vehicle too because of it, when I'm sane anyway. After over coming
weight gain, I then have had lasting un wanted belly stretch marks. To
make it worse I then was diagnosed with pre diabetes and three years
after that I was made to have a cholecystectomy. I'm constantly fighting
with any therapist and doctor because their telling me that I'm indenyl
and that I lack insight and that their experts and I know their wrong.
It's abusive when I know I am the injustice and the victim. I also have
so many experiences where I know it's a combination of North American's
or doctors/ therapist's and their laughing about my malpractice scenario
and misdiagnosis that they are trying to make me feel different, less
intelligent or wither I'm more on the autistic spectrum. It's
furthermore abuse. I even had one GP write caution on my patient paper
when given to another GP. All my life before and even still now I've
disliked my father. But I've always obviously been financially dependent
on him. He tells me wither I'm disabled, soft, inept, weak, pale, wither
I should be driving, wither I want to work or wither I can cook anything
without burning the house down. I not only had been socially, verbally
and physically bullied and degraded all during high school and hated
everyone in my school. I made the mistake of knowing two of them until I
was 23, when I was more wanting friends because I was in a younger
personality back then. Since high school it's been 11 years and I've
only had 9 month's of volunteer because I've had no direction for which
jobs I would want to do. There's no certificates I want to do and I
can't achieve anything from University. I won't work a apprenticeship or
a traineeship or anything with construction. I was told by one of their
mothers at 19 that I was a loser. I don't want to work entry sales,
hospitality, factory or even retail most likely. There's no route to
direct my life in now.

                    I'm worried about my future because I'm going to be 30 this year and I'm
still having trouble getting a job. For the time being I'm fine because
my parents are letting me live with them and they will also be helping
to get an apartment or house, but we don't know which one would be
better. I feel like it would make more sense for me to live in an
apartment since I will be living by myself and it would be cheaper, but
my parents are worried that there might end up being some scary people
in whichever apartment I move into (I'm very shy and naive for my age).
I know you can visit an apartment you're thinking of getting, but that
doesn't garuntee that there won't end up being scary people there. I
said to him that I will probably have to eventually move into an
apartment one day anyway and he just said ""mmm."" (I think he knows I'm
screwed either way). My older sister told me that when our parents are
no longer here that she would be able to help me out with money which is
very kind of her and she also said that I could live with them which is
also very kind of her, but to say that we don't get along when we live
together is a HUGE understatement. When we lived at home together (the
parent's houses) we had at least one HUGE fight every. single. day and
that's if it was an okay day. We literally fought so much, it was crazy!
It's got to be better than being homeless though. I'm hoping I will be
able to get a job soon with help from disability. If I can do that and I
one day soonish move into a house and I get a partner, we might be able
to share the bills one day if we live together. Also, do guys find it a
turn off if their lady doesn't have a job? I wouldn't mind being a
housekeeper if my bf was okay with that just as long as he picked up
after himself and didn't order me around. I would enjoy keeping the
house clean and tidy. I moved into a group house last year and for
several months I was living by myself and the real estate agent said she
was very impressed with how I was looking after the house and so did a
lot of other people and I enjoyed keeping the house tidy. I'm assuming
most men would want us to have a job as well though? Also, I still need
to learn how to cook (other than just really simple things like fish,
eggs and pasta).

                    Greetings to fellow anonymous web-dwellers,I am a 35-y.o. who has
suffered from Social Anxiety, Depression, and OCD since adolescence. I
lost all my friends around 20 due to shame, embarrassment and stigma, as
I withdrew from the world. I thought that they would be better off
without me - I didn't want to be a burden. However, looking back my
friends were never very supportive, nor very emotionally dependable - it
was never the deep and meaningful friendship I have yearned for all my
life.Years of fruitless therapy later, I dropped out of my final
semester of university, even though my marks were excellent, due to
overwhelming anxiety and depression. I was brave, and I tried my best to
make friends, but my university experience was lonely and alienating.
Again, I withdrew from society. I soothed myself by watching television
compulsively - the vicarious illusion of company which helped the empty
years drift by. Isolated, my heart became numb, insensate to either
profound depths or exalted highs - I suffered, I was alone, but I did
not feel the intense pain, the pain that is so excruciating one thinks
only sleep or death can offer relief, that afflicts me now. I have not
had a single friend since I was 20, loneliness being my constant and
ever-present companion.However, in very awkward and unfortunate
circumstances, I recently met someone who I thought became my friend - a
true friend. I proceeded very slowly at first, and with caution, ever
having to overcome my anxiety to speak with her little by little. We
didn't see eachother very often at first. Later, unique circumstances
caused us to spend a lot of time together, talking and getting to know
eachother. Early on, she cried in front of me, and I attempted to
console her. Of course, I hid my mental illness from her - I wore my
dissembling mask. It seemed we were kindred spirits with a lot
surprisingly in common: both interests and personality traits - both
perfectionists and people-pleasers - with similar struggles and
adversities. We had both suffered in life. However, she was not at all
shy - just an anxious person. If ever I found a perfect friend, it was
her. One day she confided in me a very deep, and sad trauma which she
still continues to struggle with - resulting in suicidal ideation and
profound sorrow. At that moment I began to love and care for her deeply.
We grew closer and closer, and I tried to help her with her struggles as
best I could, and with my experience. I was often rebuffed for trying to
help her - she placed boundaries which I respected.As we grew close, I
began to feel the pain and sorrow I described above. The thought of
never seeing her again tore at my soul. I couldn't imagine life without
her in it. I summoned the courage and asked her cautiously, 'Are we
friends?' 'Yes, of course', she replied. Prior to that I often asked her
whether she actually liked me, out of insecurity. She affirmed she did.
The pain throbbed in my chest - it was unbearable. I decided to disclose
to her my sad story, and emphasised that after hearing it she was not
obliged to remain my friend. 'I am your friend', she replied, 'We are
friends'. A week passed, and the reason for I cannot say, but she
betrayed me. She renounced our friendship, and my world reeled. I was
angry and upset at her deception - her callous cruelty. I could no
longer bear to see her; we have parted, and we will never see eachother
again.I am in a world of hurt. I cannot stop my tears from flowing. Life
is empty and meaningless without her. The thought that I will never hear
her voice again, see her face, her smile, her bright eyes is unbearable.
I do not know how to cope; everything reminds me of her. I loved her as
a friend with all my heart, but as best as I can I cannot remove the
memory of her from my mind - dislodge the place I made for her in my
heart. I don't know how to deal with the heart-wracking pain of her
loss. I am in despair; I am all alone, again!Sincere gratitude to anyone
who reads this - apologies for the literary quality (I studied
literature at uni!).Yours sincerely.

                    Has anyone gone through a situation where you were attacked by the
entire society literally? I am trying to convince myself that I am
having delusions but it's more than a dream at the moment considering
what's going on. I think I am so famous in the entire country I live in
and even think I am involved in a grand conspiracy. Yes this might be
delusion but the moment people see me they attack, period. Passive
attack to make me mentally sick. I feel like a celebrity, I am kind of
enjoying little bit of it every now and then. Playing with attackers is
my new hobby and something that keeps me moving to be honest. Gotta give
them credit for that eventhough they don't realize it. But what in the
world have I done to end up like this?

                    Hi everyone, I wanted to reach out Into this forum in the hope of
meeting other people that might have been through similar to me or who
might actually understand what I’ve been through. I was bullied at
school (a girls school) which led to anxiety and depression from my
teens where I would dread going to school and feel like I didn’t want to
live. I had a group of friends that would witness my bullying and would
never stand up for me they would always say they wanted to be friends
with the people who I felt like tortured me on a daily basis. I then
left school and had a partner cheat on me and those same friends told me
they all wanted to stay friends with him. That group of friends began to
shut me out invite me to parties and not speak to me. Also a video was
posted on Facebook of them calling me horrible names. Then at my second
year of university one main girl created a Facebook group stating how
she wanted us all to be friends and move forward and as soon as I
replied they all blanked me! I became really depressed but didn’t
realise I was depressed, drinking a lot until I blacked out but just
acting as if it was normal because I was young and it was what everyone
does. I then moved away to university and I suffered at the hands of
girls again, dismissing me or being horrible for no apparent reason and
I continued in my depression. During my second year at university those
friends that I went travelling and began to move forward also with
recent help from a counsellor. Then I met my current partner but he was
fully attached to the same group of friends from school that were never
there for me more so the boys. Last year two of my partners friends were
getting married in which I felt like I had no choice to go to the
weddings with him. My partner didn’t take seriously what I have
previously been through and I felt like I had no choice. The girl that
made the Facebook group whilst at uni was going to be there. The fear in
me was real I felt like attending those weddings was causing me PTSD. I
was travelling before both and I spent a lot of the time talking about
the weddings in which I now realise was complete fear that I was not
able to understand or explain. The final wedding was horrific, that girl
had basically created a gang of grown adult women against me and I felt
completely traumatised leaving on my own. This second experience of
bullying as an adult has completely broken me. Has anyone had similar or
can understand or relate to my experience?

                    i hate the feeling of not feeling real.im in year 11 and next year will
be my last year of school and honeslty it terrifies me. i have no idea
what i want to do or achieve when im ""older"" like why am i here? what is
my purpose? and i feel like i cant be sad becuase i have so many things
to be greatful for, but deep down i'm not happy. its so hard to explain
this feeling like its not numbness but im not happy. i think its the
mood swings from being happy when im with friends then sad and upset
when im in my room and alone.I dont want to ask my bestfriend for help
becuase i know her life was so much tougher than mine and i dont want
anyone feeling bad for me and saying sorry. my sister was diagnosed with
depresssion ages ago and now is fine, so i feel like i cant ask for help
becuase i dont want to end up like how my sister was.i get these random
episodes of dissassociation quite frequently and when i snap out of it i
feel so fake, its like gettting deja vu, it freaks me out and really
makes me think like wtf just happened and then i get this wave of
dissassosiation and it repeats. a never ending cycle.i just want to be
happy and 'normal'

                    I moved to Australia from the UK a year ago with my partner of 4 years.
Before coming out here I was on the fence about the relationship. Now I
find myself questioning it daily, I am suffering from depression big
time and most of my days are filled with the dread of where my life has
gone wrong. I was dissatisfied by life in London and my career was
uninteresting to me. Yet I find myself in Brisbane, living a copy and
paste existence; and now after being unemployed for several months, I am
considering going back into my old career. I want to work and build back
my savings, but I don’t know if staying here and staying in this
relationship is healthy for me? I want to explore more of Australia as I
have been so depressed I have missed opportunities to see the country,
but I don’t think this move hasn't been the change of lifestyle that I
wanted. like I said earlier, being here is the same as in London in my
mind. I still don't get to see the outdoors much, the daily routine is
the same and I'm not interested just going to bars and cafes, and
walking around city parks. Three months ago I signed a lease with my
partner for 12 months, I felt a bit pressured into it. Since then I have
been unsettled by the commitment. I am filled with total anxiety over
the whole thing. I miss my friends and family; I feel stuck in the
relationship, and I no longer find joy in the things I used to enjoy at
all. I want to get better, but I find myself sucked down by negativity
that I am just following the wrong path, one that is not my own. I also
feel that I spend so much time stressed out by the relationship and
having to find work that I can't work on getting better. On top of this
it bears heavily on my mind that I will have to stay at this potential
job for at least a year as the past two years I have travelled and done
brief stints of work here or there. As a 30yo man I feel like life is
changing and my career is a train wreck and I am just now leading myself
down the path which I think is wrong, but is what I beleive others to
see as being right.I have no idea what to do, I want control back in my
life.

                    I am a single mum to two teens. My youngest has struggled with School
Can’t for the last few years, is very likely Autistic and we are going
through the very slow process of diagnosis. I have had to homeschool
her, while also working, for the last two years. My girls’ dad calls
them every few weeks and sees them maybe once every couple of months.
Financial assistance from him just doesn’t happen so I do my best to
make sure they have what they need. These days there is just so little
to spare so it’s been a very long time since we had any kind of break
from the constant drone. I have had Hashimoto’s disease for about 6
years now. It’s exhausting, and most of the time I have pain. Exercising
hurts, even gentle walking, though I used to walk every day. Common
foods cause flare ups but I’m so tired most of the time that I just
don’t have the energy to do better planning. By the time I get home each
day I have to push myself through all the things that need doing but I
feel like I’m letting my girls down so much. Every day is just putting
on a happy face for the world and my kids and reminding myself that we
have food and a roof over our heads and we are safe. I don’t have family
support and I’ve really struggled to connect with therapists. I really
just don’t know how long I can keep going and keep up the front. The
future is looking even harder than the present. Keeping on going was
really all I had to rely on but my health is just getting worse and the
only thing that keeps me pushing on is my girls. I don’t want to let
them down. I don’t want them to be hurting.

                    Don’t know where to start Hi people, i am 34 yo male living in Australia
i came to study my Masters after completing bachelors overseas and i did
one year job after my bachelors in IT and my father asked me to apply
for australia as it is good country etc so i did and its been 9 years i
struggled alot and after Masters or even during my studies i was
introduced to gamnling world by my friend who insists to go to casino
several times and somehow i hooked to it and not blaming anyone i was
weak minded and used to spend all my hard earned money on gambling
whether it was to recover the losses and 3-4 years went by and then
obviously i lost my mind in that time and couldn’t focus on really
really important stuff then i think went to depression and bit of
homosexuality too out of self hate. Finally got married as i always was
straight acting but never had any gf due to culture norms overseas. Due
to my bad financial planning and stuff wife left me and compared me with
my other friends who are so called settled now have office jobs and its
been few months i can’t cope up with it and still working like 7 days
but don’t know where i am heading and no plans and age is passing by
idea of working like this in casual jobs for more years kills me. Most
hurting part is i am heartbroken due to divorce. How to pit my life
together anyone in the same situation i have never seen a doctor but
think i need help coz of headache and feeling lazy all the time. Cheers

                    I only have 4 months of school left and i have quite a big friendship
group at school which would be amazing right?... wrong! the thing i can
admit is that ill always be alone. I've never had a close friend that's
NOT been one-sided, because i know I'm not theirs and i hate using the
term ""bff"" its so cliche, but its so humbling when you say ""your my best
friend"" and they wont say it back. this is so aimed at one person but
like idgaf this person will forever choose their ""popular friends"" over
me and that truly breaks my heart.is it the way i look? the way i speak?
like why cant i get equally returned love???I just want someone to love
me. its always me starting convos or organizing plans with them, like if
i stopped talking to them overall, they would even ask if i was okay.
they would just let us drift.i cant friendship break up with them, its
not an option and i cant talk to them about it so it just feels like I'm
digging myself a whole that goes deeper and deeper and deeper i know ill
always get chosen last and that really makes me upset. i wish being a
human was easy.After school i know ill barely have anyone left, so what
does it feel like to be totally alone?

made an appointment with a doctor. I feel really scared though because I

for so many years that I’m really scared that they’ll judge me or won’t

able to say what I wanna say or I’ll say the wrong thing causing them to
just dismiss me and move me along without helping. I’m just tired of

                    Hello everybody, I am 18 in less than 2 months, and that is the age I am
able to go to the doctors without my parents and get medication
prescribed to me I wont get too deep into my mental illnesses, but I'm
pretty positive I have depression and some other things wrong with me.
Both my parents have depression and both my siblings have it so I think
its very likely I have it. We also have family history of Autism, OCD,
and anxiety. But I don't really feel comfortable walking into my GP's
office or going to a psychologist/therapist for now. I can't afford
therapy and all I really want is antidepressants. I'm certain I need
antidepressants because it's affecting my life and my relationship
pretty badly. I'm alright with living with depression since I feel i've
been depressed since childhood, but I don't want to negatively
affect/worry my bf (and my friends become assholes and take it
personally when I isolate due to depression, so I dont wanna deal with
that drama) I've gotten acne prescriptions from telehealth services
before, and I was just wondering if you could ring up a telehealth
service, have a quick appointment, and simply get an antidepressant
prescription from a GP? If so, what are good services for this?Thank you

                    Hi all, I'm in a terrible way...I am 51, have no job, partner, friends,
money, anhedonia, peyrones disease, bipolar, extreme loneliness & copd.
I want to feel the connections with others again but don't know where to
start. I haven't worked for 6 years due to mental health reasons however
I feel guilty & think it's out of laziness. I busted My partner of 7
years having threesoms with 2 people I used to be friends with. I used
to see her everyday & was totally invested in her that now, I have zero
social life & with the peyrones disease I can't really meet any women!!
I've been used to a life of great success but ever since divorcing my
narcissistic ex wife in 2013 my life has just spiralled downwards at a
great pace. Oh, peyrones disease is a build up of scar tissue in your
penis that creates a bend when erect making intercourse impossible. It
also shrinks your overall size. It's one of the most soul crushing
things for anyone to go through. I am hopefully having an operation
early next year but the surgery is 34k without p/health (which I now
have and am on the 12 month waiting list) but even then, after the
operation, I won't just have chicks knocking on my front door for dates
so I'm scared I'll go through all the pain of recovery and $ spent on p/
health for nothing as I've got no friends to go our with!! (And don't
like going out alone). I just sit at home, sleep all day sometimes as
that's the only time my brain switches of for being such a loser. I dont
watch TV, don't have the radio on, I just go on my pc like YouTube etc
and mind numb myself even more. Idk if I should try and myb start
working again however it's so soul draining on you as a person and tbh,
im on the disability pension now yet I seem to be just as broke as I was
when I was working so I find it a pointless goal to chase. I have
various substance use disorders now also as a result of my messed up
life & it's harder to interact with people re driving to places etc. I
just DONT know what I should do & in what order!?! Pls any advice would
be gold, Thankyou so much.

                    About me: I’m a 37 year old male,suffering from depression on and off
for about 18 years, been on/off medication for it too, but don’t think
it ever really had an effect. No close friends or family, live a fairly
isolated life with a huge focus on my career. My story: 6 weeks ago, I
took a long planned 3-4 week vacation to USA/Caribbean. It had been in
the planning for three years, I had all work commitments taken care of,
I had even purchased a ‘burner’ emergency phone so I could leave my life
behind and live ‘essentially ‘off the grid’ for the duration of my
vacation. The vacation was perfect. Had fun, ate lots, relaxed and got
plenty of sun.But, I’ve really been struggling to come back to my normal
life. Everything has been so overwhelming since I got back. Tonight I
was walking home from work, and a song came on my playlist that reminded
me of my holiday, and I completely broke down. Last week I was at the
cinema, and the movie I was watching had themes about ‘escaping reality’
and THAT also caused me to break down. (it’s unusual for me to get so
emotional in public settings, it used to always be when I was home
alone.) im sure after a while I will just start forgetting about the
vacation and accept that my normal life is, well, a normal life… but I’m
not sure I want to. can anyone relate to this?

short I have struggled with mental health as long as I can remember, and
was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 15. After being medicated
since that age. I'm 26 now, finally managed to kick the meds about a
year ago and was feeling good about it. However, things have been going
downhill since the beginning of this year. It has coincided with my uni
work placement (ironically at a government Mental Health facility) which
has been stressful, unsupportive, and left me feeling pretty useless.
I've been struggling financially, had to stop work and move home, gave
away my dog, and am also experiencing a loss in the family. I am
reaching a point where I feel unable to do anything, let alone help
other people with their mental health. I feel I could either cry or go
to sleep at all times of the day. Nothing I used to enjoy makes me feel
good anymore, and I wake up every morning sick with anxiety. I recognise
these as clear signs of depression, and have booked in with my GP next
week to pursue a mental health plan/therapy. However, I would really
prefer not to go back on antidepressants. I'm not kicking medication
here - it can be a lifesaver (literally) but it took me several tries
over many years to successfully come off it. If I can I would like to
avoid going through that process again. So, I'm hoping some of you
lovely people might have suggestions as to other methods I can try.
Herbal medicines, routine changes, free programs, etc. Particularly
things to help with anhedonia, anxiety, and feelings of worthlessness. I
would really value hearing from legends with lived experience and offer
my sincerest thanks for your thoughtfulness in advance.

                    Hello, this is my first time posting. I have had a really tough 7 months
since I was bullied then terminated during my probation period at a
workplace as a youth worker. I lost a job, professional identity, and
good stable full time pay. I also I lost the sense of confidence and
belief that I truly earned professional opportunities, as the current
job market meant the same resume doesn't get me interviews for the same
type of jobs anymore. I see a therapist, have supportive friends, and a
loving partner. But my relationship with my parents are very strained.
Summary of what happened: I had a friend who used to work at that
organisation. They were the subject of rumours and investigations
regarding their conduct that I had no idea of prior to starting that
job. In one month, I started getting messages from that friend who moved
overseas and told me their friends dobbed me in, alleging I reported her
to my manager. Friends as in my then coworkers who gave me silent
treatments and ignored me when we ran events together, making me feel
isolated, as they obviously got along just fine with 2 other new people
that onboarded the same time as me. At the same time my parents were
visiting, and we had a domestic dispute resulting in the police giving a
home visit, and I for the first time realised I grew up with domestic
violence, and as they were staying at mine, I went to stay at my
partner's and friend's feeling like I was fleeing. In that one month
alone, I drove 50 mins to and from work (5 days in the office), trying
to learn the ropes of the job, dealing with toxic work colleagues and
fake nice managers that only truly showed their colours as they asked me
to trust management to deal with this. In the end twisting teething
issues and honest feedback as me having ""ill intent"" on the rest of the
team and fired me on ""gossiping"". All because my former friend's father
went and threatened to sue the workplace and they pinned it on me. I
have no way of getting unfair dismisssl due to having only been there
for 4 weeks. It was orchestrated and scapegoating. Since then I went
through a manic episode and have been depressive. I got a reception
casual job at a leisure centre and I cop the occassinoal abuse. Not only
do I feel zero fulfilment and shame, I cannot love my partner the way I
want to, because he got a new job after being made redundant, and is
being paid a lot more than me. No matter how suppotive he is, I feel so
inferior.

                    Hi All,Its been now another year since my last post. .My wife is still
in denial, despite still drinking in secret and hiding wine bottles in
random places. She is still angry with the world and blames everybody
but herself for the state she is in. Her anger goes from 0-100 in
seconds, and I do my best to protect the kids from it but feel I am
failing. She won't get help, to get nothing is wrong. If I leave, it
would destroy my kids.We built such a good life together, but she is
never happy. I have prayed for light at the end of the tunnel but feel
there is none. The words that come out of her mouth when she gets angry,
it is hurtful. I believe she has BPD, because if all the different sides
she has. She can be so kind and a beautiful mother, but then becomes the
worse. Not sure what to do next, just wanted to say it out loud. Thanks
for listening .

                    My older brother is quite depressed. He is in his last year in high
school, and got a bad test result. He is not himself and my mum is also
quite sad. I don’t know how to talk to him and I’m worried about him.
It’s hard for me to reach out to him because I have sport every day that
finishes late, and my dad travels a lot. I want my family to just be

                    Hi , i was feeling pretty positive about my life for the last few months
, getting back into sports, hanging out with friends instead of
self-isolating and even going on a few dates. But it doesnt quite feel
like any of that matters. it almost feels as if everything im doing is
monotonous, low stakes and just unexciting. idk if its because im
experiencing another episode of deep depression or feelings of
worthlessness, but i just cant help but say to myself- ""Im just not
happy"", as cringe as that might sound. worst of all, i have feelings of
longing to be apart of something matters in some way because i dont
think i matter myself. So these deep feelings just sap my energy and
enthusiasm to take risks or do something positive with my life. I dont
quite know what to do. This is has all become like a routine loop for
me, and id like some advice or help on the matter. Because im just tired
of my depression and issues just dictating my life, where i watch time
sprint and the whole world go by while i just waste away.

                    hi. i'm 13, and this is the first time i've done this before. it feels
weird, reaching out, because my whole life i've been forced to hide my
thoughts. it's been hard. like, really hard. i'm in year 8, and being a
major procrastinator, i've even managed to procrastinate getting help
for myself. crazy right? i do get thoughts of 'maybe they don't need me'
or 'what if when my friends say they'll be here for me, they're lying?'.
'im not sure if i have depression, but i'll be honest, if i did, i
wouldn't be surprised. i was told my life by my parents, you can cry,
we'll be there. but every single time i cry in front of them, they tell
me it's my fault and i shouldn't be crying about it. This was like the
time i lost all record of an assignment due in 5 days. i cried, really
heavily, and my mother then proceeded to say, ""thank god it's gone, i
thought the look was horrible.""im sorry what? That was 6 hours of
nonstop work and thought and she says that? really kind mum, you're such
a saint.My amazing dad then said, ""Why are you crying about this when
it's your fault? Honestly you're 13 grow up."" He then said i wasn't
allowed to cry, said it was pointless.i also did try to talk about my
suicidal thoughts. I did, i really tried. But my Chinese parents just
said, you're just lazy. find some initiative, get some discipline for
god's sake, why are you like this.my parents are 'perfect' people.
always top of their class, discplined, 'never needed help doing
homework, my parents were divorced and my grandma didnt know how to do
it' blah blah blah. sometimes i think if it's worth waiting the 5 years
for a chance to study abroad and be free for once. my parents are ok
with me hanging out with my friends, they i could go to the easter show
with them next year, but they can be so annoying and overprotective and
i just dont know how to deal with this anymore.and i just know my
parents won't help me in any way. i cant get a therapist on my own, and
i dont think i can book my own medical appointment, and my GP is also
chinese. please help me.

                    Hello! Hey there fellow people on this wonderful forum! I am posting for
the first time. I should have got a job years ago! Seriously if it
wasn't for my oblivious thinking back in High school, I would have got
one when I was like 14. That is what I should have done, except I got
one when I was 17, was there for like two shifts, then left because the
idiots sent me to the wrong house! I was a delivery driver you see. I
should have stayed but wasn't resilient enough and quit. Fast forward to
now I have been looking back on life and concluded that I should have
got a job literally a decade ago, I am 24 now, so when I was 14. I would
have been in a much better financial state and had loads of cash to go
towards a home loan. Instead I have less than five grand and I am 24! I
have now only just managed to get two jobs, both of which I haven't
started. This has deeply depressed me, but I am doing fine, thank god
for job seeker payment!!! Also thank god for my good saving habits over
the past decade or so. I really wish I got a job when I was 14 or even
15 and stayed with it! I would have had a much better Resume and found
it easier to get other jobs. Is anyone else in this position when they
look back and think to themselves 'I should have got a job sooner'? Is
anyone else in a bad financial state? Luckily I am a good saver and what
a good life for my self. I am willing to work hard and what the best for
myself!!! Please feel free to offer up some advice for me, thanks in
advance. Hopefully these two jobs work out!!! I do not want to be fired
for any reason! For motivation what I do is go to carsales and dream of
what cars I could own in the future, I love cars!!! I also look at
property for sale and think to myself 'yeah I got to work hard so I can
have a good life and have a nice townhouse or house"". You know what I
mean? Thanks in advance for all who reply! I will really appreciate it!
Thanks.

it already dead. My husband has been through hell and back with cancer,
and continued health issues. The latest being coughing and snotting
constantly - no end in sight - it’s been 5 months since it got bad. I
cannot stand to be around him, and when I am I can’t help but tell him
to shut up. Separate bedrooms now which I thought would never happenI
want to be around him. I miss our previous relationship. But I can’t see
things changing. I’m lonely, no one to talk to so bury myself in work,
horses and art. I feel like I’m grieving, and feel also guilt all the
time. I try to just go about life - I feel so sorry for him but that
doesn’t help me to co trip how I feel when I’m around. just wish I could
have someone to talk to when I feel like this. have had plenty
counseling over the years and also recently. No real solution to my/our

netball and really struggle to put myself back out there, I still have
not fully recovered due to the dislocation, it was out for 3 hours
effecting my spine and the same of my neck which effects my hips bc of
nerve damage, but thats not why i wanted to do this, I was wondering if
theres anyone else out there who has had an injury and has like
flashbacks or like gets into a state were they can't do anything but
replay that moment over and over in there head.And uh, i was just
wondering if theres anyone who has suffered this traumatic experience my
physio and chiro keep telling me ive faced,a and managed to find a way
to stop the so called ""flashbacks"" or ""states"" that im struggling to get
out of.I really miss netball and i can't play yet but hopefully i can
build up enough strength eventually to play again, so if anyone can also
maybe tell a story or give some advice about how they managed to put
themself back into doing sport even though they could injure themselves
again that would be very helpful.sorry to bother anyone whos actually

or something... thanks,Ellie

                    Hi everyone, I am really needing help and support, or even advice. I
have recently split from a 7 year relationship from what I now believe
is a malignant narcissist. I am feeling damaged and empty, and also
generally anxious and scared. I made the decision and it took 4 months
to get him to actually leave the home. I have since been told many
things he said and did that I was completely unaware of. It seems that
he had a laid a very cunning long term plan which mostly centred on my
trust and naivety. My whole sense of self has been rocked and my world
turned upside down. I am now 52 and feel so stupid for trying so hard
for so long with this person. I think a lot about laying down to sleep
and not waking up and what a relief ir would be. I have 2 children who
that would hurt greatly, so that is not an option. As a result of the
type of person he is and the way the relationship was, I am highly
anxious and fearful. There were violence and threats in the beginning of
the relationship which eventually ground me down to a fawning and weak
person. He has no empathy for anyone in general so he would actually
laugh if he knew how bad I am feeling. I have gone completely no contact
for months now, but he is now attacking me through the legal system. I
suppose that I would just like any advice anyone may have. I have been
having some counselling but it is expensive. I am so incredibly
disappointed in myself.

                    Hello I am a medically retired veteran from the policing fraternity. I
have severe PTSD and manage daily life as best as I can. My partner of 9
years has been my Saviour Angel and I treasure her immensely. I have a
son 21 and daughter 18 who are very close to myself. My relationship
with my ex wife who is a psychologist is good and she has been
supportive all through my journey living with my PTSD. Our marriage
broke down due to my ptsd and my reluctance to leave the policing
career. I was open from day one with my current partner about my ptsd.
She understood the seriousness of my mental health. I cannot ask for a
more loving partner. Here is the issue….she has a 27 year old daughter
who is married with 2 kids under 3. She and her family live with her
dad. Since the early days of my relationship with my partner, her
daughter has constantly attempted to sabotage it through the following
methods…creating jealousy issues when my kids use to visit us for school
holidays..by trying to get them in trouble by false stories, bringing up
her mum’s ex partner often to see my reaction, inviting her dad along to
private gatherings that her mum and me organise to attempt to cause an
issue. Now that she has 2 kids….she is attempting to create a bigger
conflict between her mum and myself by constantly forcing her mum to
visit her at her house where her dad lives in the granny flat. I have
for years gone along to visit her with my partner even though it’s been
uncomfortable to be around her ex husband who is autistic and has no
concept of relationship boundaries.The ex husband constantly dredges up
about my partners married life with him and relives the thing they use
to do eg holidays. I have ceased going along for the weekly visits to my
partners daughter’s house to maintain my calmness. I feel my ptsd is
getting worst as the narcissistic daughter now demands frequent weekends
away without her kids and my partner has to babysit the whole time at
her house. The daughter is very aware that her mum is a pushover and
that this is causing major issues in my relationship with her mom. My
partner works in high stress corpoarte environment and the weekends
gives us a chance to have couple time by either travelling or catching
up with our friends. I am at a crossroad now and wonder if its better
for my ptsd to rent my own place and end the relationship? My daughter
has moved in with us for her university studies and is concerned for my
mental health. She has confirmed my opinion about my partner's daughter
being a narcissist person. I have tried so many times to get my partner
to join me at my psychologist office to discuss the dire situation that
is been caused by her daughter but she says 'theres nothing wrong and
your just picking isssues'. Close friends and family have adviced me to
walk away and be happy rather then be 'gas lit' and stay in a coercive
situation.....any advice?????? Please.....

                    Hi, I am hoping to hear from other rape survivors in hope someone has
been through what I have. When I reported my rape an officer encouraged
me not to report 2 other assaults by this person because it sounded like
""risky sex"". This really hurt, because each time I was badly assaulted.
I am wondering is anyone else who has reported rape in Australia has had
bad experiences with police like me? I am finding it really hard to
understand why not all victims are given the chance to go to court due
to 'not enough evidence' as well. Of course rapists will deny it and I
just cannot understand how this is all the system does before closing a
case. Has anyone else struggled with not having 'enough evidence' to get
a conviction and bad remarks from police officers? This has really
deeply affected my trust in society. It just feels hard to understand
the world when you are raised to believe these things are wrong, yet
police support the rapist. Thank you for any insights. I have felt very
alone in this and was wondering if there are others out there who have
had similar bad experiences when reporting their rape?

they are able to outthink my every move and they got away with sleeping

my consent sadly I have no say in the matter because it's a form of

                    Hi I am new here. For many years I experienced abuse from.my husband
then left him when my daughter was 6. She has autism and an intellectual
impairment. I always ha difficulty dealing with her behaviour. We saw
numerous therapists and psychologist but no one helped me with her
aggressive, revengeful control behaviours. I honestly don't think they
believed me. I have a teaching degree so I knew how to manage children's
behaviours but I couldn't control my own child. She is now 21 and is
living with a boyfriend who is now under her control. She displays
narisstic traits. He has been so good to her and he is a kind soul. His
family is now very worried about their son and have asked me to help.
But she won't listen to anything I say to help her in any kind of way.
As a result of years of abuse from my own child I also have received
trauma from her. It breaks my heart that she is now hurting another
gentle soul and family. Is there anything I can do to convince her to
get some help?

                    My landlord has been sexually harassing me and touching me for 3years.
Due to the housing crisis I kept a diary of the happenings until it was
time I move out and then proceed to report to police. Landlord has just
found out I have been keeping records of his behaviour and has kicked me
out onto the streets. I have reported to police 2 times now as I was
told by the woman's sexual assault councillor that there is a victims
assist package to get me out and safe but need a police report number.
Police are not taking it seriously making excuses for his harrassesment.
I feel let down by police, they are meant to protect us. Police said I'm
only reporting as a retaliation because landlord has kicked me out. It's
actually the landlord retaliating on me because he found out I have
evidence. The justice system is broken in north Queensland. My mental
health is beyond control. My meds don't work, I'm on the streets were I
don't belong. Why is it so hard to prosecute this behaviour even with

escaped him.Thank you for reading. I needed somewhere to get this off my

                    I have ASD, ADHD and CPTSD (from childhood) and recently got approved
for the DSP. I should have been happy but my housemate made a comment
under her breath and then complained about dishes. She's complained to
her coworkers (I found out through someone else) saying that she thinks
I'm capable of work. It sent me over the edge and I relapsed with self
harm after 2 years without doing it. I struggle with feeling safe at
home in general due to my upbringing and I'm at the end of my rope. I
can't find any housing as I'm on Centrelink and rentals reject me as
there's a big line of people waiting and workers and families are
priorities and I can't afford a caravan. Been on the cat 1 housing
waiting list for 2 years. Anyways I feel guilty because I can't work my
regular job. Only volunteer work and my housemate and other people
believe I'm capable of regular work because the volunteering I do is for
emergency services, both fire and ambulance. (Fire gets quiet in
winter). The thing is for some reason emergency services is the only
work I've not dreaded, I love it. It's the only place that's ever made
me feel like I have any value and when I'm on a job it's the only place
I feel like I'm in the moment, like my heads calm for once and I can
work but I still struggle with some stuff due to trauma. It's helped me
with self confidence and building skills. Sometimes even when I'm
neglecting everything else and unable to get out of bed it's the only
thing I can bring myself to do The thing is tho I still feel guilty and
like I'm nothing but a dole bludger who should be able to handle regular
work. I've tried paid work again and again over the years and it's
always ended up with me hospitalized or frustrated. Because of my
housemates comments too I don't want to be in the house at all. I had a
breakdown today at the possibility of having to move town to get
housing. If I move town though I'll have to move or drop my volunteer
work and my only supports are here and I might have to rehome my lizard.
I don't want to rehome a pet due to my living circumstances again. It's
killing me, all I've ever wanted is stability and I would love to work a
regular job and be normal. I'm not sure what to do anymore. I feel like
nothing I ever do is good enough and that I'm never enough. I've thought
about paid work in emergency services but it would be a long time to be
well enough to do it full time and even then there's the possibility I'm
too mentally ill to do it full time.

                    Hello, Needing more advice and hope from the wonderful people on here as
I've got none and can't think of anything else to do. I'm at a point in
my recovery where I feel stuck, my issue is that I dream too big and
have self acceptance problems. I have CPTSD, Depression, Anxiety a
chronic pain disorder and recently been diagnosed with ADHD. I feel like
I have tried everything to get better and it's getting worse and I am
more nihilistic, everything I try feels like a failure as I'm not
~better~. I cannot accept myself and that recovery is a journey which
isn't cured therefore I cannot get confident because I must be perfect
to equal greatness which stops me from trying to pursue further
education or passions. It feels like a self fullfilling proficy. I can't
stop dreaming big, this leads to heartache when I realise all the work
it will take to get there, which is hard to believe will ever happen
because it's been 15 years of healing and I'm still falling apart at
work when criticised or feeling judged or triggered by a client (I work
in mental health) spiralling into a tunnel of worthlessness and defeat.
I want to give up DSP which I know is impossible to get for start but
then if approved I'm screwed financially and have to give up up my
rental and change the remaining things that spark any joy (hobbies that
cost money).

trauma occured. I can work other places successfully but keep ending up
back on antidepressants when I end up back and feeling I am
underperforming and in danger then of sub standard processes but when I
work any where else I’m fine. I am not haivng luck winning a permanent

                    Hello, 4 weeks ago my beloved cat was killed by my next door neighbours
dogs. They had dug under the fence and I found him dead. We followed
council laws and our property was safe for him,but the dogs dug under
the fence and we didn’t see it coming. For 2 yrs we have lived next to
them and everything was fine. When I found him I lost it screaming
hysterically. I can’t get that image out of my head. The look on his
face. The fact that it was just another normal day for us like the last
3.5 yrs,and now he was dead infront of me and in my arms. I haven’t been
okay since. I have spoken to mental health professionals and am being
treated for a variety of things. PTSD being one of them. I keep getting
triggered by my own dogs, who had nothing to do with my cats death. I
understand that. My cat was raised with our dogs and they all got along
like family. They loved each other. However now,when my dogs pick up
their toys and shake them in play, all I can immediately think of is my
cat. My mind freezes,my body feels a flush of dread,it stiffens up and
pain goes through my body.My teeth clench and my neck stiffens to the
point my head gets a sharp headache. I understand that my dogs are just
playing with their toys. There isn’t anything violent about it, just
play. But my mind still goes there. Does anyone have any advice on this?
Thank you for any suggestions. ABC01

                    Trigger warning: I was attacked by my partner unexpectedly. They have
never shown signs of any aggression before this happened. We just came
from a bar (my partner's drink may have been spiked). I don't know what
to do next. A few months after, I went out with a friend who I trusted.
I'm usually a cautious person but I trusted my friend. I only had two
beers that night but that was all I remember. I know I had about a 12
hour window where I don't remember anything but I keep getting snippets
and flashbacks that I somehow know are linked to that night. I get
flashbacks of those incidents often. Just after the blackout, I would
wake up either crying or screaming and shaking, drenched in sweat. That
lasted for two months, almost every night when I was completely alone in
a boarding house. I still get really nervous expressing this and I'm far
more cautious of the world now. I feel like I have to be vigilant all
the time and on my guard. Along with this, I moved countries for work
but I was made redundant there due to mismanagement, I became homeless,
experienced financial hardship (unemployed for a year), had a threat of
armed robbery, had malaria, and severe food poisoning. I lost count the
amount of times my life was genuinely in danger. All of this happened
overseas and within 6 months. I'm now back home and feel sick to my
stomach most of the time. I find it very hard to find meaning here when
everything is easy, and I have people around me genuinely care for me
and can provide for me, instead of being alone overseas. I don't know
what to do. I feel so lost. I see a psychologist next week though, I
hope that might help.

all day and achieving nothing. This has been happening for the last 3

leads to panic attacks that come on very suddenly. I do speak to a
psychologist weekly at this stage, and feel good after I do speak to
her, but that feeling also wears off very quickly and I’m back to being

                    The state of your mental health has a big effect on your physical
health. Anxiety, stress, and sadness can all weaken the immune system,
which means the body is more likely to get sick. Stress that lasts for a
long time raises cortisol levels, which can cause problems like heart
disease and high blood pressure. Anxiety is linked to headaches, stomach
issues, and tense muscles, among other things. Depression can make you
tired, make it hard to sleep, and change your eating, all of which are
bad for your health and energy levels. Mental health problems can also
make it hard to live a healthy life, which can lead to bad eating
habits, not exercising, and abusing drugs. Also, mental illnesses like
worry and sadness can make chronic illnesses worse, which makes them
harder to handle.Having good mental health makes your physical health
better, which helps you live a longer life and deal with illness better.
Taking care of mental health is therefore very important for physical
health and happiness of life as a whole.

                    Hi I was wondering if anyone out there has experienced a damaging life
change similar to mine which I can't seem to fully conquer. My parents
turned to an extreme religion when I was a young teenager and uprooted
me from my school and friends and basically my life. Eventually I left
but it's caused an ongoing hurt that I can't escape it's affected my
whole life as much as I try to forget about it and stay positive. I
can't talk with other family as they just say get over it get on with it
type of thing but it's a real struggle sometimes and lately I guess as I
get older I think about it more. I've never had closure as my mum died
and my father is a selfish nut who has never helped me and abandoned me.
I don't seek sympathy I've never posted on here I have always been very
independent made lots of mistakes from trying to know how to be in this
world when my growing mind and love of the world was ripped away at a
young age. It's difficult to explain and those who I should be able to
talk to aren't interested but I wonder if there is anyone out there who
can relate. Thankyou

know if others had experienced this and how you moved on from this?

                    My PTSD life. Last night I had one of my night mares It happens every
few months. There is a scenes towards the end of the movies ""the green
mile"" where the prisoners go through a mock execution hours before the
execution. The end of my nightmare was ME. I was allowed to say my last
words, i forgive the judge, the jury, the lawyers for sending me to the
execution table as you are only working on the evidence you have been
given.I then died. How I got there you ask? This was the end of my
nightmare in full technicolor. what started this was my mind trying to
identify my sexual abuses. In the nightmare I almost identified the
people but when the the imaginary face masks came up to their noses
everything went blank. Then there was the one person who over 8 months
abused me multiple times. In the nightmare again I almost identified the
person when the imaginary mask came up to his nose. Things went blank.
Between this and the green mile there was a court case I convicted of a
false charge then executed. What that court case was I do not remember.
All I remember what I just wrote. NOW you are wondering why I'm writing
this? SUICIDE is a dirty word. No one wants to talk about SUICIDE in
public.WHY? Suicide is a major societal issue AND NO ONE ONE WANTS TO
TALK ABOUT THIS. WHY? I am one of very few people who is willing to talk
or write about the problems sexual assault victims face on a day to day
bases.There are many that have survived their attempts yet will not talk
about it or simply found a way of taking their life. I am a multiple
suicide survivor SEVEN, thats correct 7 times I tried. I am a sexual
abuse survivor. I am a first generation Australian, not a great thing.
You can bury your head in a bucket of sand and say ""it didn't happen"" or
you can face reality. It took me 40 years to face all this. It took me
another 7 years to go to court and win. Its taken seven years to accept
what has happened. I have to accept that the nightmares will continue
for the rest of my life. I have to accept ""the green mile"" I will never
be able to identify the people who sexually abused me multiple time.
Remember I am not the only sexually abuse male. It seems I am the lone
voice that is prepared to talk publicly SUICIDE is real. It doesn't have
to be sexual abuse modern society can send you down the path of suicide.

                    'Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD; also known as complex
trauma disorder) is a psychological disorder thought to occur as a
result of repetitive, prolonged trauma involving sustained abuse or
abandonment by a caregiver or other interpersonal relationships with an
uneven power dynamic.' Wikipedia description.. I think this pretty much
sums it up yeah? I wish I could underline; '..relationships with an
uneven power dynamic'. In my own case, C-PTSD was triggered by bullying
in my workplace from 2008 until 2014. I developed symptoms such as
Anxiety/Panic that grew in severity until a tragic breakdown in 2014. I
was forced to medically retire. Although my history of multiple trauma's
and childhood abuse caused specific responses in me from an early age, I
thought I was normal and everyone was the same. In fact, a lot of people
in my inner circle were. Decades later, I find out those friends/family
members/acquaintances had gone thru their own traumatic situations. So
why wouldn't I feel normal around them? Today, as opposed to the
70's/80's (my adolescence/young adulthood) where abuse wasn't discussed,
people have resources to out their pain and confusion in spaces like BB
forum or with psychologists, social workers, medico's, psychiatrists and
even friends/family. Treatment has become the 'norm' instead of going it
alone which is what many of us here had to do until society caught up
with this 'pandemic' (IMO) of psychological disorders. So, why create a
thread dedicated to C-PTSD? Well, stigma and misconception around it's
still rife in our society, and people suffering with this horrible
disorder and not realising it is a constant. Your views are absolutely
welcome! We really do need to talk about it as consequences of C-PTSD
and the benefits of therapy are worthy and an important part of
recovery. Newcomers and current members alike are encouraged to post;
old, young, male or female. Let's pick each other's brain and see where
it leads... Kind thoughts; Sez

                    I live in Sydney & the recent incidents of violence against women has
prompted me to write this. I am a woman in my mid-fifties (look 10 years
younger) living on my own in a villa for nearly 7 years now. I have an
obnoxious neighbor, a single man in his seventies whom you could call an
incel (involuntary celibate). His villa is next to mine & although he
has a backyard, he seems to spend a lot of time in the common area in
front of his villa, even sunbathing there in full view. Initially he
used to peer in thru my living room blinds till I put up some thick
curtains. He then began fiddling with my rubbish bins and putting his
rubbish in till I moved the bins into my backyard. He then shifted his
attention to my letter box, putting some gum like substance & then
sticking newspapers into it. I tried blocking the letter box by filling
it up with junk & he would spend hours trying to still push things in. I
then realised that there was some sexual innuendo going on. Disgusted I
permanently sealed up my letter box and then the next step was that he
began stalking me. I also cannot sit in the living room & literally have
to tiptoe across the house because if he hears me moving around inside
the house, he starts making weird noises. While all this has been
happening, to cause me further stress, I also began experiencing sexual
harassment at work. The man whom I shall call Geri is 65 & divorced.
Geri began leering at & propositioning me since day one and didn’t seem
to get the message to back-off even though I told him that I had
partner. He would approach me pretending to ask a work-related question
all the while staring at my chest. I managed to mitigate the situation
by trying to avoid being in the office on the same days as him. What
struck me about Geri was his sense of entitlement & his delusions that
at 65 he was some kind of catch. Could write a lot more but restricted
by the word limit! So, what exactly is wrong with men in AU that they
feel the need to control & harass women? It’s bad enough for men to be
abusive in a relationship but this post should provide insight into the
kind of behavior some women put up with even when they are not in a
relationship!! There is talk about educating men but is it really
education that is required here? Maybe allowing for video capture of
incidents to name & shame would be more effective.

                    Hi everyone, I’ve been struggling with ptsd (diagnosed by psychologist)
after being robbed at knifepoint on the way to work one morning.
Everyone around me has been really kind and supportive and my boss has
been amazing about checking in and accomodating work as needed. But even
with all the support I have (which I am very grateful for) I just feel
really alone and then guilty for feeling alone. My husband suggested I
reach out on here and see if anyone else has been in a similar
situation. Logically I know that everything will be okay and that I
really am safe most of the time but I just feel so afraid and anxious so
often. Just walking in my own home I feel my heart start to race every
time I turn the corner or turn off the light. Every time I try to sleep
I’m experiencing flashbacks and panic attacks and frequently waking up
multiple times throughout the night from nightmares. I’m seeing a
psychologist and trying to get in to a psychiatrist - but everyone I’ve
asked is booked out for months. I’m just starting to feel like this fear
will never go away.

                    Hi lovely people, Some of you here may have followed some of my earlier
posts, but I have complex PTSD from years of domestic violence and abuse
from my current husband. My anxiety levels are very high right now.
Leaving my current living arrangements isn’t an option at the moment or
this time in my life. I am 56 and still need to work and somehow run a
business with my narcissistic husband. Lately, he is becoming more and
more vile and nasty with his words and taunts. He knows how damaged my
self esteem and self worth is and he is the cause of this. I try to be
civil and reasonable in living under the same roof but he’s getting more
and more angry and hostile to the point of yelling at me to move out if
I don’t like IT. He has yelled at me several times and lately in front
of our sons, aged 27 and 29. HE knows that since giving up my apartment
in 2022, I have nowhere to move out to. I don’t have any friends or
family contacts or support. Not even a friend to talk to about this. I
can’t keep burdening my sons with this. I am scared that he is pushing
me to the brink once again. I have come very close to ending my life
several times but I can’t do that to my children. I want to live and
enjoy watching them grow and hopefully have their own children one day.
He’s making me feel like I just want to end it all. Just abandon this
life as it’s not ever going to be good. I will always have this trauma
to haunt me forever. Thank you for being here and listening. Fiatlux

                    Back in 2019, after 16 years I disclosed child sexual abuse to my
closest friend. I had always recalled it but I suppose I never processed
it since I blamed myself and brushed it aside as not meeting the typical
‘criteria’ of sexual abuse. Initially my friend was supportive but after
a few months she began to get frustrated at my seeming lack of progress,
I developed an eating disorder, self harm, anxiety, depression, met the
criteria of PTSD. I was attending therapy weekly and things were getting
sorted, but I guess she couldn’t handle it anymore, she broke off the
friendship.So since then I’ve told a few other friends, because
sometimes it feels like it’s burning inside and I want to get it out.
But every time I tell, I get insecure. What’s more I feel like I
shouldn’t bother them with it again, like I’ll ‘use them up’ as I did
with my closest friend before. So I end up telling more people than I’d
like, just to not burden one. A few weeks ago I was triggered while
getting dressed in my wardrobe and recalled a fragmented memory through
an emotional flashback. I felt ambivalent about discussing it, still do.
But it kept bothering me (and after dismissing my own experiences for so
long I tend to seek external validation) so I decided to message a
friend who I’d told once before about the CSA. I messaged late at night
and she replied in the morning and asked how I was feeling— I responded,
and she never replied again. I felt pretty rubbish. After weeks I didn’t
want her to try and reply this late, so I messaged about something
random and she responded, ignoring my other message. So that’s the
story, what I was wondering was…Would you take it as that friend isn’t
available for trauma discussion, although they did ask a question?~

                    Ok, so, I am continuously feeling lightheaded, I am continuously in
pain. And I don't know what to do. I want to know that I am safe but I
don't know how I can tell. Whilst feeling lightheaded, this happens even
while I'm laying down. I have blackouts here and there, and I passed out
in the middle of textiles class once My lightheadedness has been
happening for a few days now and I don't know what to do about this.
Could someone please give me advice?

                    I just need some reassurance,Last August I was feeling very dizzy,
lightheaded, my eyes were blurry, i was feeling like i was in a dream, i
felt as if i was sick or was dying, honestly every symptom imaginable..
I had all these tests done; MRI, blood tests, heart tracking, etc. I've
been to therapy too. I'm only 17 - everyone is telling me i am young and
that this is a phase, as it's not like i have had it all my life. Forgot
to mention, in August when this started i had the flu for around 2
weeks, i was feeling really sick, one morning i woke up at like 4:00am
and went to my parents room, because i had a temperature and i felt
sick, whilst i was standing in the dark bedroom i felt nauseous and all
sweaty, i felt like i was going to collapse, then i realised everything
felt more darker then normal i turned on their light and i couldn't see
anything, everything was black! I My mum just said that i wasnt eating
and drinking and that is what must've caused it, along with all the
medication i was taking. But i happened another time too.. It was around
2:00pm as i was riding my dirt bike, i felt off and wasn't concentrating
properly, i fell off at high speed after almost crashing into my sister
(i hit the front brakes going downhill, in which i know i wasn't
supposed to - i just panicked). Long story short, I broke my wrist,
anyways when i fell off i had another blackout, which i was told it was
also because it was 2:00pm and i hadn't eaten.. Then not long ago my
heart started racing and it happened again. I am literally so scared
now, but i've just been told every time this has happened i was because
i hadn't eaten properly which is why now i try my best. Anyways, that
isn't the point. The point is 2 days ago i got a cold, and i feel so
bad, i think it is from my anxiety and my cold together.. But, the thing
is. I feel like i can't think properly, i feel really out of it - like i
don' feel real, nothing around me feel real. I feel like my head is
tight and i am stuck in a dream, i don't feel right, i feel like I'm
weak and everything i touch and do it isn't necessarily me that is doing
it. So, i don't know if it is because of my cold that is making me feel
off and my anxiety that is overexaggerating the feeling i am
experiencing, but i feel like something is seriously wrong, what is
happening to my brain, i am scared. It doesn't feel like my anxiety
where it goes away when i occupy myself. No matter what i do i feel so
out of it. Please tell me i am safe!

                    I went to see my mental health nurse today. It's a fortnightly
arrangement. Today I showed him a statement I'd written for the redress
scheme. I couldn't tell him in words what was done to me at age 16, that
was more humiliating and shameful than the sexual assaults, rape,
harrassment and threats of rape.I suffer nightmares weekly, sometimes
multiple nightmares a night.He read a certain part of my statement and
then said, this is terrible, I won't read anymore. He was supportive, we
discussed why I feel so powerless, so angry, and scared all the
time.Starting from age 11, I was molested by a teacher for five years,
bullied by students from the age of 4, the bullying turned into physical
assaults and what one police detective termed as torture, I was sexually
assaulted by a friend's boyfriend at age 13, 16, and raped at age 20. I
never got to feel safe or heal from the first initial trauma before
suffering trauma, sexual assaults on multiple occasions. Now I'm almost
45 and I still suffer really bad flashbacks.

                    I have a psychological claim with Comcare that has been going on for
years. I want to get away from them and out of the system, but they (and
my awful employer) keep hounding me and sending me for multiple
psychiatric exams and IMEs. They will not find me a job, will not give
me a redundancy and will not put me forward for medical invalidity. I am
just kept in constant limbo. The rehab consultants ignore all the
medical advice and have not been able to find me a job. I have found the
rehabilitation consultants to be the most useless nastiest pieces of
work. They act like policemen telling me everyday to call up friends and
beg for a job. They told me to do charity begging work even though I
have poor social skills and anxiety. I am unable to approach people and
beg for money. After 10 years of this ongoing crap, I am very unwell and
don't know what to do anymore. Comcare said if I try to challenge
anything or don't do what they say, they can go back and raise a debt
against me for 10 years of payments (hundreds of thousands of dollars)
so I am in a nightmare with no way out. Has anyone been through this?
Can anyone offer advice or assistance as I need help. My anxiety is
extreme and my doctor has prescribed sleeping pills to help me sleep as
I lie away all night worrying. I am likely to end up jobless, cut off
all benefits, and homeless, and the thought just makes me cry.

                    I was very distressed by what occurred but not for the victims. Before
hearing much about it I wondered what had led the person to commit these
acts. Had he received help with schizophrenia and possibly other issues
he had? Alot of information seems to be sensationalised to grab the
attention of viewers. As we all know when we're mentally ill it can be
hard to seek ""great, quality help"" quickly. Maybe you can't get in for a
few weeks to see a Dr for a psychologist referral. Maybe the psych isn't
the right fit. Maybe you can't afford the cost of the dr or the psych.
My family has a history of mental health issues and some of them self
medicate with alcohol and think they dont need to see anybody. I
couldn't help but think what if that was my brother! Basically, more
help is needed!! Thanks

                    I have finally left my husband of 25 years after years of physical but
mainly the mental abuse over the last 2 years. I should be happy that I
finally left but I’m not. I hate him what what he did and breaking me
like this. I was a strong person and never did I think I would ever feel
like this. And yet for some stupid reason I love him and just want him
back. I don’t have any friends or family to talk to and this is the
first time I’m reaching out like this. I have spoken to someone through
this website before but it was a one on one so I don’t know what to
expect but I just want to feel like someone cares and smile. A real
smile not the fake ones I’ve been giving out for so long now. To top it
all off our lease ran out and since Thursday night I have also been
staying in my car with my 2 dogs. Thought camping would be fun but
didn’t count in them being so protective that no living soul can walk
past if in sight and the poor ducks didn’t deserve the scare they got.
One of the dogs broke her collar and runner trying to give chase. I feel
just as stressed here as I did at home. I don’t have anyone to talk to
and the fact that I’m feeling hate and love for the one person that’s
been in my life since I was 15 is just adding to the stress because all
it’s doing is confusing me and making me angry or upset. At the moment I
feel like I’m all cried out and I feel so down. I went to a quiet part
of the river and I’m on my own here which is great for when I just get
overwhelmed and have a cry but I wish there was Simone here who just
pretends to care. Someone that could help me feel better. I’m sorry if
this is too long and boring. I feel like a hug so badly. Does anyone
else feel like this or has felt like this and what do you do when you
have absolutely no one to go to. And my dogs are all hugged out and they
don’t hug back unfortunately. Lol

                    Only recently my mother passed away, 12 years after my father, they had
been divorced for years and the marriage was not positive shall we say,
my mother had some emotional issues and sort attention where she could,
my father was overbearing and their marriage was splattered with random
events of violence, my elder brother bought into my father's view of the
world and my mother, whereas for some reason I was on the outer with
him, the accusation quite often thrown my way was ""your just like your
mother"" in various negative formats, so I developed a distance between
myself and my mother, I was never close to my father or my brother yet
it is interesting to me that to all their circles they were perceived to
be great guy's. I copped quite a bit from my father on occasion with at
one stage having my upper thigh & bum almost completely black with
bruising, I have seen my brother take his stepson into a room with the
son emerging with a black eye when he slipped and ""fell"" on the bedpost,
but the one I feel for the most is my mother, she went through her
entire life being rejected by those around her, she was promoted to
everyone as ""OH that's just her!"" by her family, by her husband and then
her children, she faced physical violence when he was drunk or feeling
bad, she was a timid soul and must have been scared witless at times by
my fathers ""Righteous"" rage when confronted with a cold or dried out
dinner because he had spent the evening drinking, she faced being put
down her entire life, but the worst I think that was done to her was to
have her children turn on her as my brother did or turn away as I did,
most of this I only realized after she had died to my shame, we kids
were weaponized by a parent in his one sided war against the person he
should have loved and supported, now I am left with regret, and a
struggle to reconcile and process a lifetime of trauma, however I have
broken that cycle of violence and need for power and control, my family
although not perfect is relatively normal and my children are much
better parents than I ever could be, but now I grieve for what could
have been, for my mother , for me , for my children as we were robbed of
the opportunity to have a relationship across those generations by
domestic & mental violence,

                    so i have cptsd and i wanna know if anyone else is living like this. i
feel like no one is gonna reply but i am desperate. i am fearful and
scared all the time. like fearful for my life all day and all life. i am
no longer in 'danger' and do not still live with my abusers but I still
feel like I am unsafe. Its like being fearful of everything around me at
all times. like even if no one is there, I am still looking behind me
and chekcinhg everything all the time because I am scared. i also get
really bad physical symptoms of the trauma, like vomiting and difficulty
breathing. it is not just from time to time my heart is racing and i am
scared - it is all the time. It does get worse when i have flashbacks
etc but my constant state is fear. How am I supposed to live like this?

                    i was sexually assaulted last year when i was still 15. this man and i
talked for months and he treated me horribly so we took some time apart.
eventually we came back and by this time i had healed and gained so much
self worth. i set my boundaries and he surprisingly respected them, i
was so happy with myself. my first encounter with him after setting my
boundaries was a sexual assault which involved him jumping the fence and
telling me to keep my mouth shut. i didn’t react for a couple of weeks,
i think i was just processing what had happened and why i was taking way
too many showers every night. one night i cracked and confronted him and
to be honest i felt no glory in being proven right as he said “please
**** please **** don’t tell anyone” i couldn’t do anything. couldn’t say
a word because i would be called a liar, couldn’t over react because
people would think i was asking for sympathy, couldn’t tell my friends
because he was in our group. couldn’t tell mum because i felt so ashamed
and disgusted in myself. i struggled for months and my grades dropped as
well as my relationships. i cut everyone out and lost myself completely.
i realised that after all those months of worthlessness and depression i
hadn’t gained any justice because that boy was still walking around
thinking i had let him off easy. i’m yet to report the case or tell half
of my family and friends but i’ve come to terms with myself and that i
deserve better than any man with similar intentions. although it stops
me from experimenting with relationships it also stops me from getting
more hurt and that’s been my main priority since the assault. teenage
girls don’t get enough of a voice for this kind of thing because it’s
NOT normal and shouldn’t be brushed off the shoulder. i’m now completing
year 11 and trying to get myself back on track with grades and trusting
those around me. I wish that girls any age experiencing something
similar can grow through this experience with me and get their justice.
We deserve nothing less.

                    I was abused emotionally by someone who I thought would protect me. When
I was young, all I could do was cry my heart out. I learned to keep
quiet and shut myself up. It took me years to be free from that, and I
thought I could get away from it if I was free, but I still have trauma
from it. When someone shouts at me or someone else who's near me, I
freeze, my heart thumps wild, and I'm sweating bullets every time it
happens. I really wish that I could live life without this fear in me.

                    I have a lot of childhood trauma including coca(child on child abuse),
sa, loss of loved ones, emotional/physical abuse.This caused very bad
flashbacks in episodes at nighttime for a long time, though I've been
healing and it's been a while since I've had one of those now. But a lot
of music from those years still triggers episodes of ptsd where I can
feel, hear and smell my abuser. It's horrible and uncontrollable.
Luckily, music from then doesn't get played that often, so I'm usually
fine, and I tend to carry earbuds with me in case.Sadly, I still get
into fights/arguments with my parents, which can trigger a lot of
emotional distress and cause a spiral into a major depressive episode.
These episodes often consist of memories/flashbacks to those I've lost
to time and can also trigger a ptsd episode to the abuse. My mother has
anger issues that she refuses to adress and my father has chronic pain
issues that cause him an amount of depression and can also make him
prone to anger as well. So what should, i think, just end up being a
playful disagreement which we all come out of understanding one another
better and as better peopple, usually spirals into a big fight that
usually ends with me in tears and not being able to stand in the same
room. I always have to leave to try calm down, though by then it's
usually too late to sotp the spiral. I am clean of self harm over two
years now and I am so proud of myself for it, but these fights with my
parents keep getting worse as I gain self confidence, self respect, and
knowledge of what's normal and not in people as I get older. I know my
home will never be violent, but I know my parents don't like that I like
guys and girls, or that I am sometimes a girl and sometimes a guy. and a
part of me always worrie that the fights could turn physical one day,
even if rationally I know they won't. Because someone I loved physically
hurt me in the past, I'm always scared of it happening in the future.
Sometimes that 2 year streak is hard to keep going.

                    Due to my ptsd and trauma from my childhood and early teenage years I
started smoking pot and tobacco at age 15. I'm now 22, I struggle with
anxiety about basically everything as I've had such a sheltered life and
no real experiences. I left school at the age of 12 due to my home life.
Something I regret immensely. But I've spent all my time since 16
sitting in my bathroom smoking, every single day. I don't have friends,
hobbies, activities I do outside of being at home. I basically go to the
shops every week for food shopping then straight back home. My health is
getting worse, my teeth are becoming black and I've recently just lost
half of one at the back causing so much pain. Due to that I've had a
realisation my life is headed no where. How do I get out of this funk of
always smoking, feeling like I need it but not doing anything with my
life. How do I commit to a full-time job when I've never had any sort of
commitments like that before. I struggle to adjust to the thought of
spending 8+hours a day at work and having barely and time for myself but
on the other hand having no money for dental, a house to live in, a
car.. I feel so lost. Like I'm the only one who's messed there life up

                    I've had a lifetime of struggles and I'm still struggling with the
aftermath of how people have treated me. Growing up I was the oldest of
many siblings in which we had a abusive farther and a abused mother. My
farther physically, mentally, and sexually abused me up until the age of
15 until I had finally had enough. He physically and mentally abused my
siblings. I spent my childhood confused and hurt and now from my recent
understanding I had autism. I did everything I could and took as much as
his rage from my siblings I've done, been through and seen things that
the average person don't understand. I've had 2 siblings go through
cancer. A mother that's incapable of not only looking after herself let
alone anyone else. I had a child young for which I found out my ex
purposely pregnated me so I wouldnt leave. For which he turned into my
farther and mentally, physically and sexually abused me aswell. Until I
finally couldn't take it anymore just over 2 years ago and disconnected
and shut down for which I finally walked away. I've not cone to the
understanding I have autism cptsd, ocd, anxiety, severe depression. I've
entered a new relationship for which I now no that my trauma from the
past is effectively rising up. I have bouts of crying all the time. I
struggle with communication, eye contact. Over explain and talking but
to softly. People pleasing issues. Emotionally intense. Severe inner
personal critic, abandonment issues and the list goes on and on. It
would be great to find people who lived similar situations to provide
how they have overcome even some of these things and how? I'm scared
alot, I get triggered regularly and there is next to no support
available just wait lists everywhere. I'd like to feel safe to discuss
the things I went through is this the place or is there advice on where
I can speak my truth to maybe get it off my chest and relieve some of
this pressure cooker thoughts so I can see if that may free me even just
a little. I've struggled with sharing as the experiences I went through
I can't find people who actually understand without crying. Thankyou.

                    I recently had two scares within a week where I nearly lost my 7 week
old baby. I struggled with fertility for years, multiple losses & then I
finally fell pregnant. Pregnancy was traumatic in itself as I was high
risk the entire time always terrified I’d lose her. I was diagnosed with
antenatal anxiety. The moment I knew she was coming I was filled with
anxiety that I may reject her because of how anxious I had been but I
couldn’t have been more wrong. I fell inlove with her from the moment I
saw her. I was so happy & full of life just because of one little lady
who can’t even speak to me. Until a week ago, I was changing her & she
vomited, choked & turned blue. She was unresponsive but only for 30
seconds. When she came too I was obviously terrified but was relieved. I
saw the hospital who advised everything was semi okay & she had just had
a reaction to her vaccinations that caused her throat to close. This
brought on a lot of anxiety & instilled fear into me but after 2-3 days
I started to feel more confident again. Until, yesterday. I was holding
her, she was just drifting off to sleep when not even 30 seconds later I
realised she wasn’t breathing. She was limp & blue. I immediately
dialled 000 & the ambulance came. After 6 minutes fully unconscious she
came too, but was in & out of consciousness. This was absolutely
terrifying for me, I was breaking down when the ambulance arrived & took
her. I couldn’t stand to think of my life without her, she almost died
in my arms. What if I was sleeping & I never noticed? I since then have
been in the hospital with her where she has been okay & is just being
monitored. No one knows whats wrong. I am terrified. I keep having
flashbacks, nightmares & getting chills. I can’t hold her because I see
her body pale. I have PTSD which I am no stranger too but never like
this. None of the trauma I have been through is like this. This feeling
is indescribable. I am not sure where to start. I don’t have the answers
to heal yet but I can’t physically or mentally live how I am after this.
I can’t sleep, eat & I can’t stop crying. My brain has gone over the
worst multiple times, preparing myself for what may be. What would you
call this? How do I deal with this? I am so scared. Will I get over
this?

                    6 years ago today an event occurred that changed my life forever. I went
to work, and 18hours later when I finally walked out of that place I was
never the same again. Looking about at the person I was before it, and
who I am today....I can only describe it as losing my soul, the guy I
used to be ceased to exist. I've lost so much, my home, my life, my
drive and any sense of happiness or enjoyment in the short journey of
life. I'm resigned to the fact that I'm never coming back, no treatment,
medication or self will can ever remove this pain I live with daily.
Everyone I know tells me that they believe in me, they believe I'm still
inside and they believe that I can overcome this. But they're wrong, the
person I used to be could of overcome those things, im not that person
anymore. No one seems to understand, it's like my mind and soul left my
body that day...but my body kept living. There's no better life in the
future, just more days of pain and suffering. I didn't ask for this to
happen to me, im not a religious person but I find myself asking god did
I do something in another life to deserve this punishment. For someone
whose job was to lock evil up to protect the innocent, I am now a
prisoner inside my own mind. Yet, there is no key for this door and no
one can hear me screaming to be let out. I look forward to the day I see
that light shine through the darkness and im finally at peace I'm not at
risk, it's just a very hard day for me.

                    Hi Everyone I haven't been on for a while but I felt an urge to come and
and make a post. So here goes. I have had personal experience with
Anxiety and PTSD and Depression. So I wanted to get my expression of my
thoughts out there in the hope it can change other people's lives for
the better. I felt very lost for a really long time I also felt that I
couldn't really turn to anyone because I felt they truly wouldn't
understand me. I relied on the professionals and my incredibly faith
that I have. When you are going through such intense pain suffering and
struggles you do not know how you can overcome it. But just know when
you feel like you have it rock bottom and feel like you can't get any
lower than the only way is up from there. I know this because I've been
there. In those moments when you feel so incredibly alone that all you
have left is your faith which I've always had faith I just got lost
along the way for quite a while. But when I was in solitude I prayed
with everything in me that my life was going to get better and that's
what I literally hung on to was Faith and Hope and I do believe in
miracles because im a living testament to this. It's my hope through my
personal journey thus far that it will give other people the hope and
courage to hang on and know it can and does get better. It hasn't come
easy for me at all and I've worked bloody hard to turn my life around.
And I know if gusts will and determination and the will to fight
anything is literally possible. All the very best please takecare of
yourselves and know you are incredibly deserving and worthy of all the
love and happiness in this world. Thankyou Hope

                    Hi All, I am a 50yo man. Recently I have started with a new
Psychologist, and she started asking me questions about my childhood. It
would seem that I might be repressing events that might have happened to
me at a very young age that are in my unconscious mind. There is known
childhood sexual abuse by a grandparent in the family so this could be
what’s in there.The moment she started exploring the topic I had an
emotional (tears) and physical reaction (couldn’t sit still/squirming in
the chair).I am not sure if I want to open up, as this could be very
painful to explore. At the moment I don’t know if I was abused, or I saw
something or I just think it happened to me.I appreciate everyone is
different, but I would like to know what others think, is opening up
beneficial?I am also not sure if I should be discussing things with my
wife and kids as I go through this, after all, I don’t really know what
happened so there is nothing to discuss really, I do have symptoms, such
as mood swings, some alcohol use, a lot of anxiety so I think I should
be saying something?

                    Hi Everyone im going to post on here something that is incredibly
difficult for me to do. But I feel it's the only way I can get out whats
inside of me. So here goes I was abused as a child and being abused as a
child is on a whole different level to being hurt in anyway as an adult.
I was abused not once but twice. First by the one person in my life that
I believed was supposed to be there to keep me safe and protect me. Then
again from an outsider. So yes you could say my whole world had
literally had falling apart. And that is such and overwhelming and
intense place to come back from. But what scared me even more was
allowing these people to win over me. So I literally fought for my life
tooth and nail to crawl my way back from the depths of hell and such
despair in my life. Please if anyone can take anything away from my
personal experiences in my life. Then I feel I am doing the right thing
here. I truly hope this is not to confronting for everyone but I feel I
needed to share this. Please takecare because mental health is so
important and it should take precedence in your life. Please takcare
everyone. Hope

                    Hi, I didn't really know where to turn to or reach out for support, but
I'm hoping I can get some advice from here. My partner and I have been
together for nearly 6 years and got married 3 weeks ago. For about 2-3
years I've known that my partner is actually addicted to porn, and it
wasn't until the end of last year that he came to the realisation too.
He has finally started getting professional help and had even made it 3
months with watching or viewing anything. I was so incredibly proud of
him, and I could tell that our relationship was growing healthy and
stronger because of it. However, a few days ago I realised be started
acting really distant. He has had allot of stress recently due to work,
study and outside family pressure. I tried to push past it, but looking
back, I probably could have done more to have seen what was really
happening and I could have helped. Last night we started to become
intimate, and for the first time in our whole relationship, my partner
was struggling to perform. We obviously stopped cause it was clear
something was wrong. I still found this a little strange. I had to pry
over and over before he finally told me the truth. 4 days earlier he had
watched porn, and now he had been watching for the past 4 days. Pretty
heavily too. I was so upset and angry. I felt disgusted and wanted to
yell. However, I didn't. I've done some research over the past few
months and understand that's its in times like this that he needs my
support to get through. So I pushed all my feeling aside, and we stayed
up all night talking about what happened, why he relapsed and what we
can now do to help him. By the way he was acting this morning, I can
tell he is trying his best to be positive. However, I'm really
struggling. I don't want to turn to him for support cause I don't want
to burden him when he is already going through so much. To make matters
worse, I have a history of self-harm and suicide, and this whole
situation has triggered those feeling of not being enough and feeling
like I'm not worthy. I don't know how I'm suppose to be reacting to his
relapse and I don't know what to do with my emotions. I want to help him
through this journey, and I feel like I've got no one to support me. But
I don't know if that sounds selfish of not. I guess I'm just looking for
advice on how I should look after myself during this time and what I can
do to cope? Any advice would be helpful, or even if people have gone
through something similar that would help. I think it is punching a
little harder too cause it's his first relapse. Thanks.

                    Hello,I’m Clancy, I have been trapped in a relationship that is becoming
increasingly toxic by the day.I have been in this relationship for 32
years. I have attempted to break free on three occasions previously,
once prior to being married, where he threatened me with physical
violence.In hindsight this should have raised a large red flag, however,
when he broke down in tears I felt doomed.My husband will not allow me
to severe the ties. His controlling nature has intensified,and he is
constantly demeaning. He is careful only to do it behind closed doors.I
am currently recovering from a health issue, largely caused by my
environment. I have a checklist of tasks, and just have to work through
those.Any advice from someone who has been through a similar situation
would be particularly helpful. As well as general advice from
supporters. So grateful to have signed up to this forum.

                    Hi all. Was watching channel 9 “my wife my abuser” and it struck a nerve
and I found myself feeling sad for the abuse I took physical , mental
and emotional. 16 years in a relationship marriage being berated for the
smallest things ie hanging a tea towel slightly uneven. I can’t perform
a diagnosis of my ex wife but it looks like the text book narcissistic
behaviour. I found myself fully functional at a in charge level of one
of Australias largest companies to coming home and being a mouse of a
man . We have been separated for 9 years now and there was the classic
text harassment and denying visitation of a child. What I’m looking for
is does anyone know of a narcissistic survivor group or similar in the
south east of Melbourne. I’ve tried one on one counseling and didn’t
find it helpful apart from the sharing my story. Seeking a survivor
group. thanks

                    As a child I had nightmares from a very early age. I would often have
the same nightmare over and over. I won’t go into details but they
involved severe threat of inescapable annihilation and obliteration. I
can still get these same dreams now that are versions of these childhood
dreams. They have come and gone over different periods of my life. Over
the past 5 months I’ve been in a nightmare phase again. I’ve been woken
by two last night which is pretty normal at present. Other times I go
through phases where I haven’t had nightmares and thought to myself, I
don’t really get nightmares, like I forget the fact that I have had
bouts of them. I think this is a kind of dissociation where I blank out
the experiences. Then I am plunged back into them again. I am wondering
if others have found or learned strategies for managing nightmares with
PTSD or CPTSD? I just read about an interesting therapeutic approach
this morning. It’s called Image Rehearsal Therapy. What you do is write
out the dream but with a different non-scary story where there is a
safe, positive resolution. I am going to try this. It sounds similar to
the Somatic Experiencing work I have done where you go through a
re-enactment of a past trauma where you get to act out the actions of
self-protection and escape you never got to do at the time of an
incident. At the moment I have a lot of terror all day everyday and then
it manifests even when I’m asleep. In the last 5 months I sleep between
about 3-6 hours most nights. I often then sleep in the afternoon and
have strange, disturbing dreams then too. I guess I’m wondering if
anyone has overcome their nightmares and if so what seemed to help?

                    Recently, I got into an awkward situation with my tutor, who I have
become friends with over the sessions. We still got work done and had
friendly conversations about things that were about our personal lives.
Overtime I also started developing feelings for him but never said
anything. Then last month he was telling me that he was in his
girlfriend's house and that they started dating 5 weeks ago and how they
met through mutual friends. I was sad but happy for him too. I noticed
over the online tutoring session, he started whispering at random times.
I asked him whether or not he was ok but he just said ""I'm just talking
to myself and I guess to you."" He noticed I was upset and asked me if I
was ok twice. I then said I'm ok and that sometimes I worry about making
him feel awkward about saying things that might be too personal. He then
said ""I know that I'm your tutor, my time is paid and I'm a bit older
than you, but if you need me, I can be your friend"". Then I said that I
was going to be sad about him leaving to the UK. Then he said ""Don't
worry, I'll be back next year"". I was then given hope that he'd like to
be friends with me after tutoring and my final year of high school,
which is what I'd like since we have spoken about our personal lives and
got closer. Then, I mentioned the whispering in our next session and he
gave me a different answer saying ""I was just upset, that you were
upset"". Then the next session, I opened about my concerns of his
relationship since I have never heard him whispering over a zoom and he
gave me different answers to it and his relationship seemed to have
progressed really fast. He then got defensive and started telling me
that we shouldn't talk about our personal relationships and getting into
our personal lives will complicate things because he is my tutor. He
then said ""I know I said 'Don't worry, I'll see you again next year' but
I said it because I say it out of habit to my friends who say the same
thing but I never see my students again after the HSC"". I was just
sitting there feeling really awkward when he said that because we have
spoken about personal topics and he knew that I broke up with an ex
boyfriend because he was toxic (He never said anything about discussing
personal topics for the past 9 months of our tutoring sessions until
now). Plus, you don't just say ""Don't worry, I'll see you again next
year when you dont feel close to someone or see them as only a student"".
I felt like I was given false hope and thought I was a friend to him. I
also started suspecting that something is fishy, maybe the relationship.
My friends also agree something is weird. At this point I am questioning
whether or not to say anything about feeling awkward to my tutor or
leave it. Did I do something wrong here? Is there something that is my
fault and I'm not aware of it?

                    I was involved last November in a car accident while responding to a
volunteer situation.My arm got severely injured. I have had a surgery
and I am due for one in a couple of weeks and another down the track.
All up, I was told it will take me up to two years, with little chance
of regaining full motion. i have lots of trouble accepting the time
frame, and in a way I think the extend of the injuries. I am active and
all of a sudden, I need help for the basic things. i also have trouble
dealing with the volunteering which I can’t do fully. I love that part,
i love the people. Seeing all this and knowing I can’t do it just breaks
me. My husband is part of the organisation too so I can’t disconnect
completely, even for a little while. My husband says “i am not fun”. I
know I have bad and good days, which is normal. This will change me I
know. I know that done things will need to change but I can’t seem to
accept my injury and what it means, not only now but for later.

                    I am 33 years old married for 9 years and have 2 beautiful kids. I am
experiencing so void in my married life. My husband is well educated and
hard working guy. He loves his kids and can do anything for them as far
as I know him. Its his behaviour with me, he is always busy working or
on call with his friends. He never touch me or hug me ( he touch me when
we have sex) But like normally he never holds my hand or say anything
that can show his affection towards me. I work full time mostly from
home as my husband but we barely talk. He talk to his friends and family
all day long on phone (not sure if this is normal). when ever we fight
he accuse me of being possessive and say that I do not want him to go
out even say so many mean things eg, ""You are a Zero"", ""you do not have
any friends"", ""you are brainless"" , ""you are not a good wife"", ""you do
not like my family"". But I never have a issue if he go out with his
friends once in a week but my problem is he never ask me to go out with
him we never went to a romantic dinner or just night out after we had
kids. My whole day I work take care of kids , clean the house, make the
meals and sleep ( once in a while we have sex). its not that we never
had good time we do but now its like we are too busy earning money and
saving money that there is no value for emotions. some time I feel like
I do not want to live like that and just kill my self but then I think
about my kids. sometime I cant breath thinking that one day my husband
and I will get divorce. I have spend last 9 years totally dedicated
towards my marriage and kids and I cant loose it. what should I do? is
there anyone out there who can help me ?

                    Long story, sorry! Am in such torment. I'm 50 and my mother (now 79) is
a narcissist and emotionally abusive my entire life. My Dad left so it
was just her and I. As a child, I had to pretty much parent myself, her
behaviour was childish and neglectful. As a result of her neglect, I
ended up experiencing trauma at other's hands, several times which only
adds to my PTSD. She provided shelter, meals, clothing, and even gifts
for Xmas/birthdays But couldn't provide love or interest in me. She used
emotional manipulation and a lot of guilting - eg: telling me ""Maybe she
should just kill herself"" if I disagreed with her. If I were upset,
she'd call me a baby and tell me she had it worse her whole life. I
became a perfectionist, trying to be perfect in every way. I became
overly caring with everyone to the point of neglecting myself and my own
needs. Still, due to crushing guilt, I kept her in my life and my
children's lives. She continued to rage at me, in front of them for
silly issues (always when my husband wasn't present). She snooped in my
passwords book and read all my emails in my account, logged into my FB
account from her computer and had access for a year before I realised.
She told me she hadn't felt love for me since I was a child, she mocked
me mercilessly when I cried, mimicking my voice and tears even in front
of my kids. There is so, so much more but too much to write here. Every
now and then she will act nice and send a gift or a card, but whenever I
ask her to acknowledge the hurt she's caused me, she goes silent and she
has never uttered the word sorry in her life, she tells me I am the
disturbed, crazy one and I need help, not her. In 2012 I moved with my
husband and children to Australia (I am from the US) - for a better life
and to be away from her. I have tried to extend olive branches at times,
photos and updates of the kids, trying to visit when back in the US. It
has always ended badly and with me in tears. Nothing I do is ever enough
for her. A visit is ""bad"" because if I don't give her all of my time on
a visit I am horrible. I'm going home for a visit soon. She has had
other email me and bash me for not giving her enough time when I get
home. They don't believe she's abusive and told me I am selfish. Now I
am not seeing her but the guilt is crushing me...to death. She just
wrote that she's 79 and might die soon and I'll be sorry when she is on
her deathbed (she's currently very healthy). But I feel crushing guilt.
Help.

feel like I’m a total burden on my family as it is and also feel that
I’m being railroaded by my workplace ( which is very toxic as it is ) I
now feel that even if I win to prove my innocence that I’m in a loosing
situation. i think I need to see someone professional about this and
pretty soon to get the A&D under a bit of control before my mind
explodes as it cannot turn it off.

                    So. I thought I was lucky. Job I loved. Amazing team working for me.
Made a difference to the company. Smashing it. Finally I was someone my
kids could be proud of. I own my own home. None of this came easy. I
have a really dark past. I used to be someone I didn't like but I grew
up. I didn't let trauma dictate my future or make me be who I could have
become. I put my big girl boots on. I studied doing a bachelor of social
science. With the intention of helping people I ended up in a factory
job as a supervisor due to financial circumstances. There was someone at
work who really needed my help. To give her some hope i even took her on
as my 2ic. I went above and beyond. Anyway they ended up making some
really bad decisions. Im talking fire on the spot call the cops and
child protection. I continued to support for 2 years.So now she wants my
job. Said it to my face in front of someone.All this time later and many
many instances in between I am now in trouble for finally snapping and
saying a few immature words. Yeah I know. Not great on my behalf.(This
is where the trauma and ptsd kicks in).Who knew working with your
abusive nasasitic pathetic excuses of a mother who kicked you out at 14
to have a better life with her boyfriend would suck so much. But now it
looks like she is the flavour of the week and I will be loosing my job
my home everything. All for what. Being kind to someone and trying to
help them out is in my blood. I would probably do it again.The question
now is. Do I be a role model for all the other people and the toxic
place I work and risk losing it all or say my bad suck it up and
continue in a job where I no longer feel safe, appreciate or basically
human.I have gone from being ok to really not ok. I'm not ok I can't
afford to loose my job but I can't let them win. It would crush my sole
and everything I believe in. Oh but the way I have a 11 page file on
everything she has done to me. Team members who have gone to hr telling
them they have been put in danger by her drinking She has a person who
heard me slip upI can't even process what is happening and why work are
supporting her side. I don't know if I have any gas left in te tank. I'm
not after money or to make trouble.I don't want anything but a formal
apology from the company saying sorry for the gross negligence on their
behalf.

                    Last year a family member died overseas, and literally no one asked if
they could help me cope with the loss. I just went to a few counselling
sessions but found it unhelpful, and my new job got in the way. My new
job was fast paced and I received no support and was fired. I stayed in
a house for a few months while a family member was overseas and started
thinking about adult content creation as a means to earn money.
Immediately I was used for my money and bullied online for wanting to
get involved. Eventually I was used by an adult content creator for
their own gain and afterwards they rejected me, as did all the others.
Desperate for work I started a stressful new job and quit after a week,
my job agent offered no moral support. Shortly afterwards I decided to
try to get into escorting and it ruined my mental health. Only in the
last 2 weeks I have started to talk about it and a couple of my support
workers have shown no genuine concern. Even one of them gaslighting me,
after they forced me to tell them everything. My job agents have no
concern for my wellbeing and offer me minimum wage jobs with the least

                    Hi everyone, I experienced a traumatic memory tonight after briefly
watching Ambulance Australia on the TV of something I witnessed years
and years ago... I was very distressed. Having really bizarre and
abnormal thoughts, fidgeting and having cold sweats. I contacted
Lifeline and talked about the memory with one of their counsellors who
agreed that it seemed to be very intense. Then I took my PRN... after a
few minutes it felt like the memory was just being zapped from the
inside out. The noise was becoming quieter, the image started fading out
and it came in short bursts rather than like watching a movie. I guess I
wanted to write this post to let everyone know for the next time that
you're in distress... to have faith in your medication as it can help to
calm you down and may have potentially even saved me from a hospital
admission tonight. Thanks for reading

suffering from my past above mentioned crisis’s.Cutting to the chase: I
am now in a fairly great relationship, i am not harmed in any way…but
me, myself has become toxic. He’s never cheated on me. I am always hyper
vigilant of his communications on fb, or should he talk to a female: and
lash out if he does. I’m becoming controlling, and aggressive. I speak
the most venomous and hurtful words - just to get a response. I’m
constantly worried he will leave or cheat - despite his reassurance….and
it’s killing our relationship. I blame him for everything and anything.
I have spoken to my dr who thinks it maybe related to my pain I suffered
from my work related injury-but it’s not. I’m viscous to my friends,
refuse to take calls and have lost half of my family….My fiancé is aware
of my condition, but he’s kinda at a loss as to what to do…I literally
only have two emotions atm: angry or sad….today being my best day is how
I’ve managed to even write this post. I want the happy, goofy,
unsuspicous me back- so bad, cos life at the tmiembtnjust doesn’t seem
worth the effort ….thank you if you’re still reading my little rave…

                    I was born into abuse. Not as bad as some, worse then others. I can't
remember loosing my virginity, or who took it but I know I was very
young. I was molested and raped by my family from before I can remember
until the start of my teens. Tried to speak with my mother when I was
very young, I was told boys are boys. Later to keep quiet and that it's
over. Don't break the family. My dad left when I was 11. Overseas,
started a new family. Left us with mum. She was an addict, neglectful
and abusive. She tried to murder me. My brother, my rapist, saved me.
Mum had countless boyfriends. Abusive relationships, both sides. Years
of listening to screaming, physical fights, violent sex and mental
breakdowns. Years of suicide threats and uncontrolled rage, jealousy,
hate. Had two younger sisters I tried to shield. But ran when I was 15.
My sister's both ended up being molested. One by my mother herself.
Ended up in an abusive relationship with my first. 8 years later and 2
girls, I left. Had a good career and beautiful children. Chose to do
better and did. Married my childhood best friend. Wanted a fairytale and
ignored a lot of red flags. Started intensive trauma therapy, after a
year I was given an ultimatum to let him know about my past, be apart of
the therapy or end things. I worked with my therapist for months to get
the courage. Wrote a letter to my mother confronting her. She was still
in my life. They all were. I told him. He said I was disgusting. That he
didn't sign up for my trauma. That he would share my letter on social
media to show the world how f----d up I was. I didn't understand. We had
a little boy and the girls were so happy and loved him deeply as a step
dad, I was a wonderful partner but he thought I was dirty. Used and
broken. So I moved on. I shared my story with my whole family. Put out
into the open everything that had happened, what they had done and the
pain and grief that it has caused me. And I was cut away. Called a liar.
My mum tells people that I had my brother at my wedding, I had him near
my children - my rapist - that I chose it, that I'm a terrible mother,
neglectful, abusive, can't hold together a relationship. Pathetic. A
wh--e. She is dying now. She was diagnosed with advanced MS, with
multiple lesions on her brain. We haven't spoken in years, I'm off
social media, blocked her from all my accounts but occasionally she gets
a message through, just to call me something. Tell me she hates me. It
was my birthday two days ago, she commemorated it by making sure I got a
message calling me awful names, a f--- up, a bad mother. That she is
dying and she'll hate me until the end. Never own it. Never be sorry.
Decades of therapy. Medications. I do so well. Have an amazing job, am a
great mother, a good person. But I have flashbacks and nightmares. I
feel like a can't breathe sometimes. I feel hollow at other times. I
know what it all is. But I'm just sitting here thinking, I'm tired.
Life's been really hard. And I've done a really good job to get here,
for the kids, they're ok. If I died now, theyd be ok. I've set them up
financially, with love, with strength, with each other. I could go and
these episodes... Fighting this battle again the utter worthlessness,
hopelessness and soul wrenching pain will be done. Because I know now it
won't go away. It will always be here. I will never find peace with this
and fighting my mind, finding the strength to choose to continue and
look for happiness is exhausting. I feel like I've fought hard enough
now.

                    Hi all! It's been a little while since I've started a new post because
I've been extremely lucky in that everything has been going well.
However I found out on Saturday night that my ex partner is now in jail
and it kind of threw me for a loop. We were together 9 years and he
always battled addiction and obeying the law. In the end his ice
addiction changed him and he became physically and emotionally abusive
towards me, even putting me in hospital twice and cheating on me.
Leaving was hard because I loved the person he was before drugs but it
was the best thing I ever did as the person he became was hurting me a
lot. I don't love him any more and have had no contact since leaving
(about 7 months ago), I have an amazing boyfriend now and have well and
truly moved on from the past but I don't understand my feelings when
finding out about his situation especially because everyone saw it
coming, including me. I feel shocked, sad but also overwhelmed with
relief that I don't have to be the one picking up the pieces for him
while he was in jail. I feel devastated for the person I once knew,
despite the fact that he hadn't been that person for at least 18 months
due to his ice use. His sister has tried to contact me but I don't want
to see his family because I want to leave him and any ties to him in the
past but is that selfish of me? After I left, all I felt was anger and
resentment for him and didn't care at all about what happened to him.
But now that something has happened, I feel sad? And although I feel
sad, I still have no desire at all to make contact with him or see him.
I'm confused about my own emotions which is frustrating. I've been
talking to family and friends about it but everyone seems to think I
should be so happy with him being in jail after what he did to me and of
course, his own actions put him there but I just don't feel happy about
it. Always grateful to be able to vent here : ) Lots of love Gem

                    Hi all,I am recognised as having DID. I am still very much in the start
of the process of learning about how we work and and working on
communication, connection etc. I am not pursuing an official diagnosis
as there are already enough issues experienced due to other
conditions/diagnoses. Anyway the point of this post is I am wondering if
any others with DID or OSDD have experienced blocking or distracting
away from switches because you feel like it is 'weak' to 'give in' to a
switch? Previously there has been fear and shame and things like that,
but this seems to be new. We have discussed briefly in therapy, but
didn't come up with any ideas. There is still lots of doubt & denial
being worked through, so perhaps it is related to that? Thanks

                    Hello, Seeking help to find appropriate support services in South
Australia. I about 30 years ago I have endured significant violent
trauma. Witnessing violent death perpetrated by strangers. All my life
I've lived with a physical difference in my brain that contributes to
anger, anxiety, depression, learning difficulties and poor adaptation to
change. My brain is physically reactive. As I've gotten older, my
abilities to manage memories has become increasingly difficult,
re-sending events and night terrors. These terrors lead to or contribute
to significant seizures that are causing injuries ranging from milder
ones like bruises to recently fractured vertebra. Does anyone know of a
psychiatriac online or phone service in South Australia or Nationally
who can work with my psychiatrist to help manage issues as they arise?

post another one here, so I'm sorry if I'm doing it wrong. I feel like
I'm going crazy now because my abusers (they are my family members)
contacted my friend in Japan, asking her to talk to them. I know what
they are going to tell her, they are going to tell my friend that I am
crazy and have mental health problem and don't believe me, I know my
friend understands (because she saw some of the things that they did to
me) and but she says she is scared now. I contacted the authority in
Japan but they say I should hire a lawyer. My PTSD symptoms have
skyrocketed ever since, I've already lost so much hair due to all this
and am going bold... my wig is too hot and feel like it's making it
worse... my hair loss making my social anxiety worse too. I don't have
any friends here in Australia, I contacted Grow meeting but no answer...
so lonely and just crying.

                    I’ve grown up with trauma my whole life. So many people would comment
you’re such a strong person and so resilient. These people knew most of
my traumas but not all. its true, I am, I was a strong female who had
compassion but never allowed anyone to treat me badly. Yet as a child I
was treated so badly and allowed it. Being manipulated to feel that I
was the problem. I grew up and had great relationship and then found my
husband. We had 2 boys and life was amazing. Then I had my daughter and
the secret trauma I pushed to one side and never told anyone resurfaced
like a tsunami and flash backs began. They influenced me in ways I
couldn’t imagine and I became someone I didn’t know. Constant fear and
dread. You see I was sexually abused by my 2 brothers at a young age. I
never told a sole. My beautiful boys I would now look at as predators.
It’s not there fault but I grew up thinking it was not my brothers
fault. They didn’t know any better. 1 is a bad bad person who we have
all disowned. The other is a manipulative narcissistic person. My other
brother- was my protector. Not perfect but always my protector.the
trauma and flashbacks wouldn’t disappear and my dependency on alcohol
and stimulants surfaced. No one knows. They see me as a strong
independent amazing mum. Which I am but the trauma is eating away. I
confided in my husband and best friend and they have been so supportive
and said it explains so much. Why I continued to allow the manipulator
brother dictate to me. I don’t want to tell anyone else but am stuck in
this merry go round of trauma. I’ve since lost my dad who was my hero
and feel broken. Therapists can’t help. I know it was never my fault. I
was too young to understand. But fear for my daughter 24/7. It’s
crippling. What are some suggestions that have helped others get past
trauma

                    Former bottle shop attendant for a well known chain. I have recently
been through 2 hold ups and going through a pretty tough time trying to
recover. My problem is that i am no longer with my employer but i still
receive help from The private Compo insurer for medical visits ,
expenses etc. This means i receive an updated work cover certificates
after every visit with my GP. As I'm no longer with my employer and i
get no financial help from the Compo Insurer I now rely on help through
Centrelink. This is where the system is wrong and i get no help from
Centrelink. I recently talked to a Centrelink Social Worker and asked to
join a DES Service Provider Program to help me get back to work or try
to go back to work only to find that i can't do that because i need a
medical Certificate. My doctor won't give me a certificate because I'm
on Work Cover and she said it is against the law to give me a
Certificate for Centrelink while I'm on the Work Cover Certificate. So
even though I'm Receiving regular help From my Psychologist and GP and
on medication I am not classed as sick through Centrelink's eyes and
have been asked to apply for so many jobs every month to the point that
i was with my Service Provider the other day and she asked why I'm not
applying for Phone canvassing Jobs. I looked at her and replied that i
would be no good at doing phone Work as i can't even talk to someone on
the Phone without shaking. She then said well why have you been applying
for Delivery Driver Jobs if you can't talk on the phone. With tears in
my eyes i looked at her and said at least I'm Trying. I just feel like
I'm going backwards in trying to recover and I'm in a very emotional
state at the moment and some days i can't stop crying. The Compo Insurer
has promised me to help me with a back to work plan but I've been
waiting for 6 weeks now. So with no help from either end I'm stuck in
the middle of a system that does not help the sick. I don't want to be
on Centrelink but have no choice and all i ask is for some help with
getting me back in the work force. The Disability Work Provider (Des)
said i need a Medical Certificate to Join there Service. I just think
it's so wrong that even though i have proof of my sickness that no one
can help me with me in trying to get back to work. Has anyone else been
through this and have any answers for me. Please help me.

                    Hello, I am a 52 year old woman, and have a life of narrcistic abuse
from my mother, and exhusband. I always felt different and wondered why
things never made sense and why things were always my fault and still my
fault. I could never put my finger on what was wrong. I have now
discovered that both my mother and my exhusband are narrccists. I read
about narrcism and when I did it hit me like a brick, all the things
they say and did and are still doing to me, finally had a name. I am
trying to get help, but it seems people don't believe me, or take me
seriously. Why didn't I see what was going on? I don't know how to get
over this. My exhusband was abusing me mentally and at times physically,
for over 30 years. This might sound trivial, but narrcistic abuse is
real, and I have been left feeling, worthless, stupid and not good for
anyone or anything. If anyone can offer advice I,would be greatful.
I,wish you all well.

                    Hello,This will be all over the place cause I’m still trying to
understand all this I’m a woman in my 50’s and every once in a while I
would have this memory . Before my Parents divorced I was 13 yrs old my
father took me away to QLD and this is where the memory starts , I’m
sitting on a bed and the tv is on and “Pretty Baby “was on my father
comes out of the bathroom wearing just a towel and asks if I want a
glass of wine , I said ok and he kept giving wine . All of this is in
the third person as in from behind me like someone else is watching this
. I never told anyone cause when ever I remembered this it didn’t know
if it ever happened but I always felt anxious when it resurfaced. I also
had another image where I was laying on the bed naked with my eyes
closed and my father was touching me but it was viewed from above once
again like through someone else’s eyes. The last thing I remember about
that trip was waking up at home ( we lived in NSW ) .My father was
physically abusive and an alcoholic we were always walking around on
eggshells . My Mum passed away in 2019 and my world crumbled, Mum and I
talked all the time yes we argued but she was everything to me so this
is where everything unraveled. I went to the doctors and was diagnosed
with depression and was put on tablets and told to talk to a
psychologist, we talked for a few months and was diagnosed with CPTSD &
Generalised Anxiety Disorder. I had never told anyone about what I had
remembered until I saw a psychiatrist I told her about the one where he
was coming out the bathroom and she said that it was definitely a memory
. After all this I would like to know if anyone else remembers things
happening in the third person cause I’m just worried that if this is all
true will I remember more ?

                    Hi guys. I don’t really know how to start this. I guess it’s
complicated. I have no intention to harm myself and when I talk about
how I feel it’s always the constant worry but that isn’t what I plan to
do. I just feel like this world isn’t for me. I feel like I am out of my
body in a way-looking at myself and everybody around me and I don’t
understand how or why I’m involved in any of it. I’m very intelligent-so
I’ve been told and I look at socioeconomic spaces and society and media
and I think the good and bad in the world and the rollercoaster of life
is too much and I want to get off the rollercoaster and just feel peace
(peace alive not unalive) I don’t see myself being able to feel safe in
a relationship to start a family because I self sabotage due to fear of
abandonment. I don’t want to work everyday of my life because I have
worked so hard and am a good worker and I’m not cared for in jobs like I
care for jobs so what’s the point. I’m studying a degree that I’m
passionate about but it’s in a negative work environment
(hospital/healthcare) I care so much and I wish I just cared a normal
amount. I know I’m not the only one to feel like this but for myself I’m
sick of being in such a negative space and I feel like I’m drowning and
stuck in a pit of darkness. I have had these depression episodes on and
off my whole life. 6 months of the year I’m off work due to depression.
Real depression and not laziness. I have been told I have major
depression, mild anxiety and complex ptsd due to some physical abuse and
a LOT of verbal abuse and manipulation in childhood. CBT therapy dosent
really work for me and idk what else is there to help. Trust me, I’m not
a lazy person and have tried the whole meditation, self help books, CBT
therapy, medication, look you name it-I’ve worked really hard at it. I’m
28 years old and all I want to do and all I do is sleep lately and most
of the time anyway just worse other times. 13-14 hours a day because I
don’t want to feel anything. I don’t know what else to do. I’m lost and
yes I know it sounds really terrible like I will hurt myself but I don’t
want to and won’t do it I’m just screaming for help at this point and
looking for a way to stop hating myself and the world and being so
negative. I’m tired and have been working on myself since I was 16 years
old and I’m tired and just want things to get better and my hard work on
myself to start paying off

                    Hi out there. I am a 45 year old man and have worked hard to build my
life, but for some reason the memories of my childhood SA have been
coming on stronger and more frequently that it's becoming hard to ignore
them and keep moving forward. My older brother and a friend's dad
separately groomed and SA'd me from about the ages of 5 to 12. I never
felt comfortable with it but went along so I wouldn't get in trouble, as
they told me that would happen if I didn't play along. When I had just
turned 14, a 19 yo neighbour who i liked, trusted and thought was a
friend coerced me and technically took my 'adult virginity' I guess, but
then moved and never made contact again. After that, I was scared to
trust people but eventually let myself get into a relationship at 21,
which took a few years to get comfortable with. Since then, i've fought
hard to ignore and I guess repress the SA I went through as a child, and
it's worked out pretty ok until now as I've focused on building my life
up. But over the last 12 months the SA memories have been coming back
stronger and stronger and I'm just getting so tired of trying to repress
them. It's definitely affecting my mood at times. I worry it's affecting
my partner and relationship. Sex has an element of fear about it these
days. I know I should talk about this stuff professionally but that just
feels like a very long and horribly uncomfortable road to go down, and I
feel massive anxiety at the thought of seeking that kind of help. I've
never told anyone about this stuff, and feel hesitant to even write it
here, but I'm not sure what else to do.

                    Hi there, I am suffering from childhood trauma and family SA. My coping
mechanisms are freeze and flight impacting my life. Messed up with a
helplessness and low self esteem indoctrinated by church ‚not good
enough’ and paranoia ‚god sees and knows everything‘, I developed trust
issues as parents and church and teachers seemed omnipotent and all
knowing. Can’t build deep friendships, can’t ask for help, can’t stay in
jobs over long period of times, don’t have many friends and am distant
in my family due to trust issues. Conflicts are not resolved as I shut
down and freeze and flee to food, neighbours or hobbies. It‘s impacting
marriage and family with kids and work environment. Plagued with guilt
and shame, not being able to admit mistakes and apologise I am looking
for a support group or one-on-one to unravel these issues and help me
heal.

                    So it all just came to a end my fiancée had anoth psychotic episode on
Sunday night came home was angry he walked away and chilled and then
made me my favourite dinner fish and prawns which was weird for never
cooks and brought to me and was so loving and sweet the man I feel in
love with. then he went and had shower and went and watched tv and then
came into our room raging and smashing everything up and put he hands on
me. He then walked away and called the police saying I assaulted him
when he knows he already has a DVO and I think was his breaking out to
protect me for knew they would arrest him and knows I video everything
when has his episodes. He has had a change in his medication over a year
ago for doctor lost license and since they changed it has been having
these episodes and is total different person I don’t even recognise
anymore. I have kept trying all I can to get him to get help and we can
go together to a new doctor and or a clinic for financially I could
support us just wanted him back to the man I feel I love with but he
thought he could fix himself and still it kept happening .. and I kept
blaming the meds and kept trying to help .. so the police came took him
away and I just kept telling them I don’t want him in jail just needs to
get medication in rehab sorted.. they then called a family member of
mine and they had to take me to the station and i had to make a report
of that night then they saw more photos and videos from last 14 months
and now has many chargers against him. The house he brought 8 months
before I meet him and when I moved in 3 and half years ago we payed
double mortgage and everything to get ahead 1 payed mortgage other put
the same to the offset savings. We never changed into joint names for
didn’t want to loose the low fixed rate we had which would run out this
June and then would change. So now I have no access to any money or
anything and they weren’t sure how long the court would hold him so I
moved within 48hours and out all in storage and staying on a mattress in
a family member’s place for have no money for a bond or anything. And
for the account is all in his name can’t afford therapy even though they
say 10 free sessions through mental health plan they aren’t free
anymore. And to get a lawyer isn’t cheap either and doing all takes
along time for legal aid and all also.. I am so lost and all can think
of is the amazing life we had planned we renovated our house and we were
so happy and now in a blink my whole life is up in smoke and my head is
spinning like I am in a movie.. Am so worried about him in jail and of
course I can’t have any contact and am just so lost and having a really
bad day don’t know how my life came to this.

                    Gday, I feel like I need to get this off my chest! I’ve been struggling
again for the past 7 months. It has turned me back to substance abuse
again to cope/switch off and I’m getting worse. It all started when I
broke off the relationship with my partner but still stayed friends and
lived together. Little did i realised how much it affected her, I found
out eventually that bills weren’t being paid, she also lost her baby
sister (stillborn) and still to this day battling with anxiety,
Depression and multiple problems with her body after the covid vaccine.
I took on the role to look after her and it was very stressful at times.
Trips to the hospital and doctors. Juggling a full time job as well (6
days a week) coming home tired and exhausted I still had to maintain the
house,cook, clean and play with our 2 beautiful dogs. That was when I
started using again it gave me energy to do things around the house that
needed to be done. Work was becoming really depressing and a work
colleague who I thought was a true friend turned out to be a narcissist
and had psychologically abused me to try turn me against my partner ever
since I put my focus on her wellbeing. Since I realised for who he truly
was I tried to expose him but it seems he’s playing the victim. Pretty
much all my work mates are now belittling me and gaslighting me. I feel
like they’re trying to set me up to fail. it’s been so frustrating and
confusing as I just want the truth as to why ?!?!? Why are you doing
this to me ?!? because I have turned to substance abuse I have been
missing out on work more and more. If I keep this up I will lose my
job.The person who I get used to get the substance from, I know him well
and again I thought he was a good enough person but in that 3 month
period he must have seen how down I was at times and decided to use me
and emotionally abuse me as well, when i confronted him. He somehow
managed to turn people against me and made him look like the victim.
Great!!! My partner and I have recently decided to rekindle our
relationship and give it another try. She is dead set against my
substance I use and I am trying to stop! I’d get as much as 5-6 days
clean then relapse. I’m at the point where I feel like I’m going to snap
and go crazy and use violence because inside I’m soo angry at them for
taking advantage of me and I’m angry at myself because I just want to
stop!

                    Possibly distressing content. I have an intellectual understanding of
everything that has happened to me in the past. I have also completely
forgiven things done to me in childhood and carry no resentment about
those things. However, the impacts of early physical and verbal violence
remain in my nervous system. I have successfully processed adult traumas
somatically with my psychologist, removing the charge from those
experiences. But the charges from early childhood remain. The worst
physical violence occurred between the ages of 3 and about 7-8. While
that later lessened, frequent volatile verbal rage continued to be
directed at me. In my experience things like cognitive restructuring
have been useless as I've basically done that already and that doesn't
shift how my nervous system innately responds. I continue to have fear
triggered in daily life by situations that are not necessarily harmful,
yet my nervous system will be waiting for the harm to happen. I have
practised sitting in meditation in nature for extended periods. As soon
as I allow my body to let go I will usually vomit, my body purging the
toxic sludge it has been carrying as a lifelong thing. It seems never
ending and I am profoundly exhausted. I at least feel held in nature,
like it is my witness and it always feels way safer than anything to do
with other humans. The people I find I can really truly relate to are
very gentle and sensitive people like myself and I usually find they
have actually been through similar experiences to myself. I find people
who haven't had such experiences will judge how you should manage in
life with no understanding of visceral trauma and how it takes over when
Complex PTSD responses take hold. The world can feel like a very
alienating place of non-understanding, leading me to retract back into
self-protection and isolation. With the friends I know with similar
experiences, we tend not to go too deep into it, I think out of fear of
not wanting to trigger one another (we are all ultra sensitive empaths
so tread very carefully with one another). I think I am writing this
because I am still in this struggle and maybe wanting to know how others
have processed early life verbal and physical attack? There were forms
of less direct and more manipulative emotional abuse from my mother as
well and this would occur when she would dissociate and split off into
aspects of her own trauma, the same pattern of what her mother did to
her. So this compounded the more explicit, blatant abuse I experienced.
I am writing this out possibly because I minimised these experiences for
so many years which was a coping mechanism. Maybe I am now trying to
confront it head on. I experience flashbacks regularly, but I've been so
dissociated from them I've only recently started to grasp when I am in
them, if that makes any sense. Before I was just in them, so that is
probably progress that some part of me can step back just enough to see
I am in them now. Do others out there relate to purely visceral trauma
that comes from earliest life experiences? But please don't go there if
it is triggering. I find listening to musicians/songwriters who have
been through similar things helps because it is a form of empathy and
resonates in the body and emotions which is where I need to heal.

                    Safety planning involves creating a structured plan – ideally with
support from your health professional or someone you trust – that you
work through when you’re experiencing suicidal thoughts, feelings,
distress or crisis. Your safety plan starts with things you can do by
yourself, such as thinking about your reasons to live and distracting
yourself with enjoyable activities. It then moves on to coping
strategies and people you can contact for support – your friends, family
and health professionals. The safety planning model was developed in the
US by suicide prevention experts Barbara Stanley and Gregory Brown. It
has been used extensively by US veterans’ health organisations, hospital
emergency departments and high schools, and there is strong evidence
that it works. Many health professionals in Australia also use some form
of safety planning to support clients experiencing suicidal thoughts or
feelings, or after a suicide attempt. beyondblue has an app you can use
to create a safety plan, called BeyondNow. The BeyondNow app takes the
principles of safety planning and makes it even easier to use – so
rather than carrying around a piece of paper, you’ve got it on your
phone at all times. It’s free to download from the Apple Store or Google
Play. If you don’t have a smartphone or would prefer to use your desktop
or laptop, BeyondNow is also available to use on our website. Do you
have a safety plan? Do you have questions around how you might create
one, or fill out some of the sections? This thread is for discussing
ideas around creating a safety plan, and sharing tips about what has
been most useful about this process for you. Below are two videos
featuring Peter and Nic, who have both used safety plans successfully.

                    I have been living the treadmill for a while now. I have a nice house, a
stable job, a faithful wife that cares about me and our family and an
adult daughter. Following a bout of major depression, I have anhedonia
(avolition, but no anergia). I have energy to get things done that I see
need doing. Nothing makes me feel good more than momentarily. Most
pleasurable activities make me crave discomfort (or worse). My mood is
generally flat and I do not feel much in the way of emotion (happy, sad,
angry, jealous, etc..). I have nothing I want to achieve. I have nothing
that I want to do. I have nowhere I want to go. I have no people I want
to meet. Helping others does not make me feel good. Achieving things
seems hollow. I have no fear of dying. I have no fear of pain (also a
very high pain tolerance). About most things I truly do not care. I have
an entire alphabet of mental health conditions diagnosis (ASD, CPTSD,
OCD, BPD, MDD, PDD). I have had another alphabet worth of treatment
(CBT, DBT, EMDR, ACT, Schema, TMS). Some are still ongoing. I have an
upbringing of care for family and self sacrifice. I take care of myself
so I can do things for family so they remain comfortable. Its all done
by rote. I have been taught/trained over my treatments not to self harm.
I often think about it... These thoughts do not worry or disturb me. I
keep busy so I don't dwell on them. My family wants and needs me. I have
been in constant mental health care over the past 4 years. I have been
in hospital numerous times. I have been on (and am now off)
antidepressants. I regularly see psychologists and a psychiatrist. I
will ask my psychiatrist for another round of TMS next time we meet. I
have a lot to be thankful for. I have more than a lot of people. I am in
good physical health. I seem to avoid misfortune. I don't feel worthy of
my good fortune. Is this as good as it gets?

                    Has anyone else experienced severe suicidality in relation to
perimenopause? Did anything particular help? There is apparently a
strong association for some women. I had a major drop in oestrogen a
year ago resulting in severe anxiety/depression/suicidal ideation then.
It’s re-occurring now. I have complicating factors of c-ptsd and
complicated grief. Saturday was the anniversary of my mother’s sudden
and distressing death. I was extremely bad on Friday and early Saturday.
I’ve been calling helplines and had some practical help. It helps
regulate me for a few hours then I start to disintegrate again. It’s a
feeling of totally failing apart. I do have a psych appointment on
Thursday and I’ve booked a counselling appointment with the Australian
menopause society as well. HRT may help but I have to look at how it
will interact with my liver disease which can be a complicating factor.
It’s a rare disease and not well understood or even known about by most
medical practitioners. I just feel totally overwhelmed.

                    61 years and I'm still here but what is the point, its not going to
improve, I feel certain 61 years of this mongrel depression has proved
that and I'm so tired of it, tired of everything that goes with it, like
the guilt that you just want to be dead but everyone telling you "" no
you don't, just hang in there, reach out, there is help if you just
reach out"" for many that may be true, but for so many of us reaching out
has been a nightmare that only made a bad situation worse, for many of
us it is just going to be an endless painful struggle till at last our
numbers up, so how does it make sense to ""just hold on"" what would make
more sense is legalize assisted suicide, so us hopeless cases could
leave this world in a humane painless, no fuss or mess way, not for
those who can be got past a rocky patch and will come good but those of
us that will never be free from Depression it would really help. It
would be great to have a legal team as part of it to help get your
affairs in order so as not to leave a mess for loved ones when they
least can cope with all the rig mer roll that comes with death. I know a
lot of people will think this is horrid as they feel life is precious
and what I would give to feel that way, I did once when 1 med worked for
years, life was great and i wish I could get that back but the
medication stopped working and 45 ECT's, countless combinations of
medications, therapy, TMS and positive thinking has done nothing to
bring it back. Depression really really sucks and I'm really really
tired of fighting an unwinnable battle

me depressed when I can't hang out with her. I haven't seen her face to

almost 10 years now . Sometimes I think to myself, it's better I die
because she doesn't have time for me. I struggle with depression and
anxiety so it's been difficult. I have a prevention plan but it doesn't
help and my psychologist isn't very helpful either , I've been to like 3

                    I'm about to lose my house, I haven't been able to work for three years
because of an unidentified breakdown of skin on my hands and severe
depression and possible undiagnosed schizophrenia/personality disorder,
psychosocial maladaption, my gp won't support my tpd claim with GESB, my
superannuation and I think my sons would be better off eithout me, at
least I can leave them my home. I have no family, friends or social
contacts for years now. My mother is a narcissistic megalomaniac who is
violent, aggressive, abusive and coercively controlling, if I could sue
her I would. All four of her children are unemployable, without
relationships and in poverty, all on disability payments while she
ponces around like royalty, deluded, in her stable home she battered her
now deceased third husband into giving her. In a few weeks I will have
money from the sale of my home and nowhere to go - itinerant. Accessing
my tpd insurance and early super would change that but the ""system"" is
watching me fall through the cracks and thinking nothing of it, only
after will they lookback. I am living proof - a red flag - ignored.
Bias, presumption and judgement have clouded my gp's decision making,
the specialists are no different and there is no mental health support
out there at all. This is the system broken. Only when it's too late,
someone might consider what else could have been done. With all this
right in front of their eyes, as clear as the nose on their face, only
when it's over might they reconsider their poor decisions. Too late.
Learn now! I have been using medicinal drugs and it's made things worse
- a big step backward for its efficacy, not to mention the social stigma
and isolation. I have not left my home nor seen anyone for years now,
sleeping on my couch, temporary, on the way out, with a biological
family revelling in the drama and my demise. Can you sue parents? My
mother's gp has carved her up but never treated her twisted, abusive,
controlling, perverted and angry nature, well hidden in short
consultations. Despite contacts with services and waiting lists for
assessment, I am just one person of millions. I have lost everything and
see a future of more loneliness and suffering. I convince myself selling
my home and starting again is better than ending it. An itinerant.
What's the difference.

Maybe I am, idk. I just don’t understand why I feel the way I do as most

                    I lived too long. It is all too hard. I can't do this any more. I tried
so hard to makenit work. To reach out of my old ways and try to find a
place for love and compassion. To stop pulling back but I am just
pushing those I care about away and hurting everyone I love by being
alive. I wanted to engage the vast love in my heart, the thing I have
hidden all my life to stop it being used to hurt me. But pain is all
there is. The irony, that which I believed would make be be able to live
again is killing me. The old pain is back. I am an embarrassment, a
failure, a reject, I have lost myself and there is no way back. Just to
surrender to the mission. I need toncomplete the job. I was afoot to
believe it could be otherwise. O allowed myself the belief that I could
have life again that it might just be an option. But no. I was so stupid
to believe anyone could care, anyone was there for me. My wife hates me
my friends and not real. They don't care. My mission was to holdnit all
together to get my Child to adulthood and then I could be gone from the
world, but I allowed myself to believe that there was another option.
There is not. I want to die now. But I have to do my jobs Take care of

want to actually tell me. It’s really scary because when he did it I
didn’t see it coming, like I had talked to him that day and he seemed
normal so it’s difficult to know. It just so hard not to think I’m not

been cheating on them emotionally and physically talking to all of his
exes and also discussing his sexual life. Our sexual life with his exes
talks about me said he felt like that I’m just Sister to him that, I’m
older than him. I am older than him but not by that much. I’m not gonna
do and how much I’ve done for Guy but I’ve done a lot but what is
broken? Even more? Is the fact that he’s protecting all these people and
all these other social platforms like Reddit etc. And bagging me over 12
months to get a stroke of ego and for people to feel sorry for him and
made me out to be this evil monster which he was the one I’m working
he’s just operating around the gym for 12 hours talking to women and
plan to leave me but yet he wants a baby with me spent thousands over
$70,000 freezing my eggs and everything for Ivf Then I caught him out.
Then he rushed me to get married. Wipe me off. My feet made out. It was
his idea but then went onto Reddit that night and complained that he
didn’t wanna get married that I forced him to just say his ex would see
all this and make me out to be a monster . He tried to suicide many
times. He’s been aggressive since we got married. I know it’s because
he’s fucked up and he doesn’t wanna get caught out. I’ve got all her
details all his details. I’ve given him lots of chances a safe place to
explain to me why he denies it and makes it I’m going crazy . I’m angry
with the fact that why did he marry me if he wants to be with her he
says he’s in love with me. I’ve been through so much garbage in my life
and if I tell anybody all of my friends and my family wants to bash him
up or two, they will tell me to sell them. I know I have to leave, but
it’s getting the strength emotionally to leave His life out of his way
to find someone to screw them to justify himself. I’m embarrassed. I
trusted someone and finally let them into my life treated like garbage
for no reason. I’m starting to hate him but I just wanna know why he
can’t just tell me the trace so I can move on And why did he marry me
cheating on me because he talk to everybody? He has all of his exes
everywhere and he had violent charges on him. I’ve helped him so much. I
thought I was and spoiling and I think holidays money cleaning up. I
just can’t be bothered doing any of it. It’s like I’m just surviving ,
out of my way to watch porn and criticise but I was doing not knowing
that it was out of my comfort zone and the fact that I was doing it to
him he couldn’t take the time to even do that. Very selfish person. Know
these things but I guess I just wanna know Shall I just leave and let
him figure out but I just can’t talk to him again we’ve been through a
lot and a few deaths and he told me basically he’s only me because his
whole family will just say that he stuffed up if he lost me and he’d be
jealous of someone else had me like this. I’m not a normal person ,

                    Is it really worth holding on for help? I'm really at a point now were
the urge to end it all is such a pleasing thought, I've struggled with
my mental health all my life (I'm 30 btw) its destroyed my career and my
friendships, I've never been diagnosed, or anything, I tried to end my
life at school when I was 15 in front of the whole school... I wished it
had worked... I've seen many doctors many counsellors but nothing, still
im here, I always promised myself I wouldn't leave until my mother
passed then I'd do it, but now it seems like who cares?, everyday im
here I just day dream about how I will end it all.I've been vocal to
doctors about it and the suggest this and that, they refer you to a
specialist who has a 8 month wait until you can first see them at a
expense of my whole weeks retail wage and some more.So what are we
supposed to do? ""Oh but theres crisis lines 24/7 chats like Beyond Blue
and Lifeline"" oh cool! maybe that may help ""clicks on link, theres 15
people in front of you, EWT is 1 hour"" you sign up to something like
SANE and same thing your waiting months just to be seen or talk to
someone.The point i'm getting at here is no-ones going to save you, why
not save yourself the pain, just think once its done its done, you don't
have to worry.I've had this re-occuring thought for years now, I walk
into a hallway with my family and friends, theres a busy crowd of people
walking the other direction, I walk into that crowd and get lost to my
family and friends and they don't notice, our maybe they do for a short
period of time, then I'm gone, forgotten only a blip til there lives
expire.

I generally enjoy being here. Others I just want to end the pain, the
sadness the numbness. Recently I've been a bit better. After finding out
I have post trauma things made a bit more sense and I've been able to
work on myself a bit more but I'm still struggling more than I am happy.
I'm scared that I'll never be okay. People keep telling me I just need
to try but I do I really, really do. I exercise when I can, I drink
lot's of water, I make sure I get enough sleep, I try so so hard to
think positively, I've set goals. The thing is every single time I think
I can do this! I can get better. Something in me beats me to the ground
and say's nice try but you're doomed to a life of misery and then I'm
back at stage one. All I want is to be okay. but I don't know how or
where to start or even who I am. I act different for everyone I create
personalities and theres been times where I am like this is me I've
finally found me but then eventually I realise no this isn't me. It's
like I'm stuck in this pit that's slowly being covered up with me still
inside and the longer I take to get better the more I loose myself, the
harder it is to get better. I just want to be okay... Please if anyone
has any ideas on what I can do to get better or even just where to
start. please tell me. I'm so lost.

                    I was bullied in numerous ways during high school and hated everyone
there. I have no fond memories of what should ideally be my teens and
some memorable younger years for most people I guess. I was unhappy
until 23 because I stayed in touch with toxic acquaintances who thought
they were better and gave constant opinions and judgment. I did terrible
suicide destructive mistakes because I wanted to dumbly die, since I had
no financial support to drive, I had no direction for suitable jobs and
any opportunities regardless from my pathetic job recruiters. I never
wanted apprenticeships, construction or University, wasn't eligible
regardless or the personality to study. I also had a infatuation with a
girl that died and I got really upset since she was uniquely overly
attractive in a way that I put her on a pedestal, she was my favourite
obsession and I just went insane during that time to not care about
living and became un appreciative with my life, despite loving my
brother and mum, I wasn't thinking of them during that phase of my life.
It caused me to be mistakenly diagnosed with Schizophrenia or having
psychotic history. In 2017 at 22 I became diagnosed tragically with pre
diabetes due to detrimental pharmaceuticals. I than had my gallbladder
removed in 2020 three years shortly after which is even worse. Before
this I overcame weight gain, I've even got some stretch marks. I have
the bullshit compliance of having to continuously get scripts from my
doctors and than go monthly to the chemist and buy un wanted meds with
my limited pension income. I can't even mention about any spiritual
beliefs but it's just make my life worse, with all the unwanted remarks
and I can't even think internally or have private thoughts since their
connected. Constantly told I'm not intelligent, different and there's
gossip occurring. When I was going for my driving lessons. I had many
issues that I didn't want to deal with and I ended up having my original
O.T. therapist discriminate me, after she ignored me for one year to say
I wouldn't achieve my licence, she discouraged me to keep trying, wither
I should not spend my money on continuing. Given no support jus pension.
I've never had suitable friends who had my best interest and shared
relatable hobbies. I'm still a virgin since I can't get my life in a
ideal standard with full time work, a mortgage and even social
confidence since I've been bullied and had so much trauma or suffering
since 2008 that got worse in 2012 onwards.

                    I am a 66 year old man who shouldn't be wasting peoples time on here.
After years of depression & a couple of half arsed attempts at suicide,
I am beginning to think I have Bipolar. I am on prescription medication
for a variety of things including depression. I am a retired functioning
alcoholic. I have it all. I normally get over my issues by riding one of
my motorcycles (generally toward a pub somewhere) which helps me
immensely . (the ride not necessarily the pub). I am for the most part
comfortable with my own company but easily fall into conversation with
others. I just wish I didn't have these random attacks that leave me
devistated & emotional to the point where I struggle to deal with my
mental train of thought. I know that sooner or later I am going to
disappoint my wife & supposed friends by taking the ""easy""

                    Safety planning involves creating a structured plan – ideally with
support from your health professional or someone you trust – that you
work through when you’re experiencing suicidal thoughts, feelings,
distress or crisis. Your safety plan starts with things you can do by
yourself, such as thinking about your reasons to live and distracting
yourself with enjoyable activities. It then moves on to coping
strategies and people you can contact for support – your friends, family
and health professionals. The safety planning model was developed in the
US by suicide prevention experts Barbara Stanley and Gregory Brown. It
has been used extensively by US veterans’ health organisations, hospital
emergency departments and high schools, and there is strong evidence
that it works. Many health professionals in Australia also use some form
of safety planning to support clients experiencing suicidal thoughts or
feelings, or after a suicide attempt. beyondblue has an app you can use
to create a safety plan, called BeyondNow. The BeyondNow app takes the
principles of safety planning and makes it even easier to use – so
rather than carrying around a piece of paper, you’ve got it on your
phone at all times. It’s free to download from the Apple Store or Google
Play. If you don’t have a smartphone or would prefer to use your desktop
or laptop, BeyondNow is also available to use on our website. Do you
have a safety plan? Do you have questions around how you might create

                    I feel so frustrated at the minute I cannot find any motivation to do my
job. I am letting people down and I don’t want to but I can’t find the
energy. It takes everything I have at the minute just to get through the
day. I recently broke my back (can still walk but in constant pain) I
quit a toxic job with nothing to fall back on. I owe a bunch of money to
the ATO and my mortgage is about to double in a few weeks. I am trying
to stay positive but struggling to keep up this facade. I think I’ve
suffered from ptsd for last 2 yrs after my brother attempted suicide and
feel like there has been a downward spiral since that I’ve struggled to
come back from. He is my closer friend and I found him after he'd
attempted to take his life. I guess I’m writing this to vent but also in
the hope that someone reading this who is thinking of doing something
extreme reads it and realizes your decisions have knock on effects to
the people who care about you and you might think you are being a burden
but know from someone who has had to deal with this trauma your friends
and family will be far more burdened by your absence than anything you
could put them through at the moment.

                    I just turned 18 and I don’t know what’s happening. I have often had
some bad thought since I was 12 and I have attempted twice before and
failed . Yet still I haven’t been noticed but my family, friends and
even my therapist. My mum find a way to make my depression into hers and
blames me for what I can’t control. Stuff like being unable to keep the
house clean. I can tell my friends because I don’t want them to think of
me differently. My therapist who I go to even couple of weeks seems to
think it’s not serious. I feel like it is. I downloaded the beyond now
app to help me through the hard nights but when I had to put down people
I can talk to and reasons to live I felt very stumped, ultimately making
me feel worse. I daydream a lot and I have managed to create my own
world that I go off to when I don’t like this one. I sound like a weirdo
but it’s what I do. I have an imaginary friends that I can hear at times
and faintly see. I don’t think that’s normal but my therapist makes it
out to be. So ultimately, according to everyone, I’m perfectly fine.

                    1) I am 29 with no active payed work history. I've never wanted to be a
apprentice, do a traineeship or anything in construction or the trades.
I would struggle with Year 12 VCE and I couldn't be suited for
University. I never wanted to work the typical industries like
hospitality, sales, factory and retail. I've never known anything beyond
the limited scope of conventional work and nothing of that seems
suitable and desirable for me. 2) I never had a close relationship with
my father. I've hated him ever since I was little, It started with him
trying to make me follow his AFL football team, or he would be
overbearing and verbal to my mother. He only understands himself, His
selfish, arrogant, un caring, ignorant about many things. He can be
devious and talk behind your back if he wants to, because if things are
kept secret he won't have a guilty conscious. He prevents me from having
valid feelings and problems and sais I'm on holidays because I'm un
employed. He wants a house of peace and doesn't let me talk to my mother
if his bothered about the volume of his T.V. His told my mother that I
shouldn't be driving and that I don't want to work. All during high
school my father was complaining to him about school feels and that I
was taking days off and his friend was saying to pull me out of the only
ideal private high school I could go to. I was bullied all during high
school verbally and even physically degraded. I hated everyone in that
school everyday for six years. Generally any issue that isn't his own
problem, He just said why are you telling me for, or what does it have
to do with me.

                    I don't see any meaning in life and don't really want to live anymore.
I've been questioning why I do anything at all since I was a young
teenager. At some point, I think I came to the conclusion: ""I should
live to make myself happy and/or make other people happy"" And that must
have worked for a while... But now, I'm questioning: ""Why does happiness
matter?"" After all, suspending any beliefs beyond the physical world,
when one abstracts happiness to its basic components; is it not just
""The right neurons releasing the right neurotransmitters at the right
time""? Why do I even exist in the first place? Being an atheist, I
believe I came from a line of species that was most fit to survive in
their environment at the time. I believe that line of species originates
from some kind of primordial soup. In that primordial would have been a
simpler form of life, such as bacteria: Cells without a brain, without
will, ""alive"" because the metabolic reactions taking place in and around
them sustain themselves. That's all I think they were, self-sustaining
metabolic reactions. The result of the laws of chemistry just simply
existing. This is what I believe I am. This makes me think there is no
point in life and I'm just the result of natural selection after the
laws of chemistry/physics. But, I'm not just some unembodied
consciousness drifting in a void, I'm a human in a body, a brain: I have
emotions. I still feel sadness and inevitably will, but I don't see a
point in suffering through it. So, why not just die? I mean, there's
totally more questions to be asked though, like: How/Why does this
universe even exist in the first place? How/Why are physics and
chemistry like that? If happiness can be abstracted to a bunch of
chemicals (i.e. neurotransmitters) at the right place/time, what can the
particles that make the atoms that make those chemicals be abstracted
to? (I have no clue) Is there any meaning in the answers to these
questions? On a more personal note: I began socially withdrawing 2 years
ago, I started SHing about 4 months ago and I feel like I might allow
myself to die if I can't see a reason to live or at the very least, feel
motivated enough to live. I have people in my life who miss me and be
affected by my death, so I'd like to avoid going through with that...
But I guess, if I look at what I've been typing, It wouldn't really
matter... If you guys have anything to say; philosophical, anecdotal or
otherwise: Please do, I would love to hear it. thx 4 reading my super
long post.

                    Hi everyone. I am just wanting some advice if possible. Four months ago,
my mental health declined rapidly and I ended up in hospital for 5 days
as a suicide prevention. I have had 2 care plans done. The problem I am
having is that due to being socially isolated and not having a support
system, I am not improving. I was sent home with the plan to see my gp
and a clinical Psychologist. Problem is, I am to unwell most days to
manage getting myself to any type of appointment which may help me. As a
result, my mental health is still very bad and I am constantly
terrified. I want to do the work to try and get well, but don't know how
to make that happen. Any suggestions would be gratefully received.

                    In my experience steps post an attempt are almost set in stone. My
attempt in 1996 and several episodes that clearly were not attempts but
were approaching them, all had these steps as a process, so lets look at
them. Someone's first true attempt at taking their own life is a
harrowing occasion, it's a time when logic is removed. SURVIVE To think
about survival during this period is to have logic remaining as part of
your thoughts so that is asking a lot in these circumstances. However,
in future attempts (or thoughts) the presence of logic might be there if
you realise that you need to think that way. We are talking prevention
so we need to find ways to prevent going down to the attempt stage.
CHANGE (your environment) During an experience whereby I was approaching
an attempt and obviously very upset I knew I needed help. So as I always
suggest- change ones environment, I walked and headed towards our local
GP surgery where I told the receptionist ""I need help""... and got it
immediately. You might need to change your accommodation, partner
status... anything to avoid the direction you were travelling down.
RECOVER Time is a master but time cannot be rushed. It could be a grief
period you are going through and we all know that it takes time to
process that and there is no answer to that except forced distraction
like a sport, hobby, company of others, therapy groups and so on. Those
activities keep you grounded to your normal life activities that keep
reminding you what life was like before the spiral. Emotional trauma
isnt a nice place to exist so within us is the survivor that really
doesnt want to be there. Forcing yourself to break through from that
distraught place is needed. Get up and walk... do anything! Walk around
the block, stare at the bees, smile at a stranger... anything. REFLECT
Once recovery is in progress you'll feel better and this is where you
can look back on those days/weeks/months where you know you were at
risk. You know it wasnt a place you'll want to repeat and it is only you
that can prevent that. Reflecting is a natural way of recovering the
same as animals reflect upon a conflict with another dangerous animal.
It is not unhealthy to reflect. AVOID 28 years on I still avoid going
down that path to an attempt. I dont talk about the actual act, its too
traumatic. However the positive is that I know my limits and I know the
process I force myself to carry out as in the steps above Avoidance is
the roadblock. U-turn to see life's beauty TonyWK

ever understand suffering like I do. My whole life has been suffering. I
was abused at a very young age by my dad and it's impacted my life
forever. Every day I have panic attacks and am just sad. All I do is sit
here and listen to 100 gecs or death grips while dissociating. I'm not
built for a capitalist world where human life is thrown to the side in
the eternal chase for higher and higher profits. I truly have been
having more and more suicidal ideations and it's terrible. Nothing truly
interests me. Any sort of job would just drive me insane. Sorry that
this post is just a ramble lol i'm just putting every thought that comes
into my head down onto the keyboard.

                    Safety planning involves creating a structured plan – ideally with
support from your health professional or someone you trust – that you
work through when you’re experiencing suicidal thoughts, feelings,
distress or crisis. Your safety plan starts with things you can do by
yourself, such as thinking about your reasons to live and distracting
yourself with enjoyable activities. It then moves on to coping
strategies and people you can contact for support – your friends, family
and health professionals. The safety planning model was developed in the
US by suicide prevention experts Barbara Stanley and Gregory Brown. It
has been used extensively by US veterans’ health organisations, hospital
emergency departments and high schools, and there is strong evidence
that it works. Many health professionals in Australia also use some form
of safety planning to support clients experiencing suicidal thoughts or
feelings, or after a suicide attempt. beyondblue has an app you can use
to create a safety plan, called BeyondNow. The BeyondNow app takes the
principles of safety planning and makes it even easier to use – so
rather than carrying around a piece of paper, you’ve got it on your
phone at all times. It’s free to download from the Apple Store or Google
Play. If you don’t have a smartphone or would prefer to use your desktop
or laptop, BeyondNow is also available to use on our website. Do you
have a safety plan? Do you have questions around how you might create
one, or fill out some of the sections? This thread is for discussing

                    Hi all, I am new here. After suffering several childhood trauma, I have
developed complex PTSD, recurring depressions and chronic suicidal
thoughts.I have been living with chronic suicidal thoughts for the past
30 years. Almost every day the thoughts are on my mind; background
thoughts if it is a good day, forefront of my mind on a bad day.I am
seeing a psychologist and I am on antidepressants but the thoughts are
still there. My psychologist reckons they will never go away.Can I
imagine to one day live a ""normal life"" ( i.e., not feeling worthless
and hopeless all the time) even with chronic suicidal thoughts?
                ",SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AND SELF HARM
"
                    I’m not sure how to word this, but I feel like I’m ‘addicted’ to having
suicidal thoughts? Now, to preface this, I’m very satisfied with my life
and acknowledge that I’m very privileged. I’m also not actually
suicidal; it would realistically hurt too much and I don’t want to
traumatise my family. Since I was about 12 or 13 though I always thought
about how much better it would be if I could die, and now it’s just
constant to a point where I don’t stop thinking about killing myself
unless I’m absorbed or distracted by doing something. Again, I don’t
really want to die, but I can’t stop wishing I don’t have to wake up the
next day. Being unconscious is probably the most peace I feel. It feels
like as the days pass on, my doom is nearing, as dramatic as that
sounds. The only reason I’ve been able to make it thus far is because
I’m so privileged and because I’ve been blessed to have people who I can
depend on and who still put up with me. But I know that I can’t depend
on others forever, and of course I’m trying to be independent, but god
am I so incompetent at everything I do and I don’t have a good
personality either. I’m not kind, charismatic or optimistic; I’m
terribly selfish, introverted and pessimistic, and I can’t even do
‘basic’ things other people can do like… hold a conversation. I don’t
really go outside unless it’s necessary (eg grocery shopping, school)
because I get really anxious about having attention on me, and it’s so
sad because I want to spend time with my friends, but it’s a massive
hurdle to overcome every time and never gets easier than the last. I
have a similar-ish problem with my self harm too, where it’s just there.
I’ve started it a while ago too, but nowadays, I don’t really do it
because I’m super hurt or sad or anything (that would be a bit too
often) but it’s just there and I’ll just do it if I feel like it. Of
course I never hurt myself too much, so maybe that’s why, but it comes
as easily as writing or drawing, and I can never bring myself to care
that much about it like everyone else does. (Not that I am trying to
justify it; I would be very concerned if anyone I knew, or anyone at
all, was self-harming, no matter the degree. And it does make me really
sad to accidentally see it online, even when I try to avoid it) So, I
really don’t want to come off as insensitive, but I can’t stop wishing
that I won’t have to wake up the next day.

                    i have no purpose anymore. they ignored me and abandoned me without even
saying goodbye. why spend valentines with me if you're going to abandon
me for someone else. we used to be together but they had to break up
because of how busy and stressful their life became - moving to
Adelaide, living alone responsibilities, uni, work, working out, etc.
they told me they weren't ready for dating. it was understandable. i
waited so long for them. they still had feelings for me, it was obvious.
they just weren't ready. i just wanted them to be happy. i just wanted
them to be satisfied in life. i wanted to be there for them everyday to
support and comfort them. i wanted to help them with anything and
everything. i was prepared to invest so much time, love, and effort for
them. so much for not being ready for dating. they lied to me. all the
things they've told me, were they all lies? they even said they missed
my cuddles, and used some of my cologne i gave them as a valentines
gift. they said this just prior to abandoning me. i trusted you. but i
guess i shouldn't have. you wasted my life. i can never get back the
time you took from me. my heart is irreversibly damaged. i have no
purpose anymore. therapy is too expensive - 280/hr is bs. i feel like i
have no point anymore. i didn't even wash my face this morning. i dont
know how much longer ill still be alive. i dont want to die. everything
i worked for was for nothing. im sorry. im sorry i wasn't good enough.

meant to celebrate being here, but of course I can’t tell people that or
they’ll worry.I feel exhausted, like I’ve got so long left before I can.
And in the meantime I have to pretend to be a person when I can’t see
any future and I can’t really remember a time that I have. Work and
health has been bad lately and I’m thinking about it more. I haven’t
been having impulses yet, but where I’m at right now seems so familiar.
Like I’m just on the edge of a bit of a meltdown.I feel bad that I
periodically post here. I don’t really know what I want from if, and I
wish I could help others more. I often just don’t know what to say, or
what I need. I think just writing helps a bit because I don’t talk about
this to anyone in real life. So, sorry if you’re reading. And thanks.

at what cost?? I thought l had finally worked it out and done well to
get where l am despite it all and decided that l deserved all the things
l wanted for myself that l was always made to feel l didn't. But here l
am years later with what seems like everything l wanted and life but the
isolation of covid took a toll on my mental health and now l can't hold
a job longer than 6 months at a time l, my moods are all over the place
lm sad and angry all the time my partner and baby girl need me to have
my shit together but lm ready to just die. I know it's not right but the
guilt of feeling like a failure to them is too much and l can't afford
the phsyc bills needed to help me to get out of this fear driven cycle

i worry about others who will feel so put out by my passing for about a

                    How do you forgive yourself when the voice in your head constantly
brings up the things you’ve done. If I can’t beat this it will consume
me and that will be it. The only advice my psych has given me is that
I’m not a bad person, I just made a mistake, a bad one at that but I
need to forgive myself and move on. It sounds so easy , everything I’ve
done just replays. I hate what I did, it’s not me. Others have forgiven
me but I just can’t let go. I don’t know how to let go. I want to be
free of this darkness that is shadowing me.

                    Hey everyone. I've recently started a new job that I was really keen for
but I've ended up hating it. It's not what I expected at all. It's super
repetitive and boring, and I'm on my feet all day which I hate. I have
so much pain in my back, hands and feet since starting there and I have
to get up at 4am every week day. I'm not new to depression and suicidal
thoughts, definitely had them before but it's all come back because of
this job! It's a struggle to wake up in the morning, I feel so depressed
I don't usually eat anything and then I'm starving later, and the
suicidal thoughts are just there straight away, sometimes lasting the
whole shift. I wouldn't actually do anything but I'm just not coping
with how much my brain and body are struggling. I am looking for a new
job and I hope I can get out of this one ASAP but in the meantime I felt
the need to reach out. Can anyone relate? I would quit if I had money
saved

                    By best friend thinks I’m a bitch. It hurts because I thought she knew
me better, she knows everything about me, family issues, depression,
etc. I’ve always expressed my love for her, to make it known that I
appreciate her, yet one day she just started excluding me to hang out
with this other girl, this other girl’s really nice and I hold no
resentment towards her nor to my best friend, because people grow apart.
I knew I still wanted her in my life, but I also knew I had to stop
diluting myself into thinking that I was her best friend anymore, so I
distanced myself, got closer to other people. She started acting weird
so I reached out and asked if everything was okay, it wasn’t, she was
mad at me. I asked why and she said I was being a bitch toward her, I
explained my feelings and she boiled it down to “you can’t act like that
because I’m not choosing you enough” that hurt. To have all your
feelings boiled down to something seemingly so petty, it made me
question myself, was I being a bitch? Am I overreacting? It’s still hard
to answer those because I love her and empathise with her point of view.
She told me she needed a break from our friendship. That hurt as well.
Thinking back on all those memories, it seemed like she threw it away so
easily. She hasn’t spoken to me since, I respect her boundaries and
haven’t engaged in any conversation either. But part of me is mad, so so
SO mad, mad that she excluded me then had the audacity to call us a trio
(a trio where 2 people hang out on a weekend and never invite the third
apparently), I just wanted some empathy and understanding from her. I
love her of course but part of me wishes she’d falls down the stairs or
something. I feel like absolute shit, I’ve started self harming again, I
called lifeline for the first time ever because I had no one else to
turn too. The worst part is I feel like a bad person, whether I was
being a bitch or not I feel like one for wishing bad things on her. It’s
hard.

                    Hi and thank you to anyone who is reading this. I am 26 and I suffer
from Bipolar 2. I was diagnosed almost 3 years ago and I don't cope any
better now than I did back then. I am definitely self aware now and no
where near as reckless and chaotic when I am in my highs but none have
been as crazy as before I was diagnosed and medicated. My lows however
are just as bad as they were the first time. I feel and think the worst
and find it really hard to stay positive and I guess look for the light
at the end of the tunnel. The thought of passing away is more ideal than
it is scary. The best way to explain it would be that I dont care if I
died. I know thats not the right way to feel but its so hard not to
think that way and just know that it would stop all the pain and just
crappy feeling. I struggle to let out how bad I am mentally because I
dont want the people around me to look after me anymore than they
already do (Mum, Friends and Girlfriend). I visit my therapist pretty
much fortnightly which is a big help but even her I cant tell her how
much I think negative thoughts. I am embarrassed that I do feel this
way. I message lifeline in the night sometimes to just kind of let it
all out when I cant which I do feel helps a bit and because I dont know
who is on the other end I dont feel bad for putting all my stuff onto
somebody else. I guess this is kinda what I am doing here. so thank you
so much to anyone who does read this. I just really need help as to how
to completly open up to my therapist and the ones who care about me and
tell them how bad I really am doing. I just need help and feel helpless.
Thanks and I am sorry if this doesnt make sense. M

                    Just to be clear I don't intend to leave the planet any time soon and
I'm confident that I will stay that way. I am what happens when someone
completely and utterly gives up, but stays. I was pushed past the limit
nearly a decade ago. I've never attempted to shuffle off this mortal
coil, but it's not because I wanted to stay. I don't believe in an
afterlife. I know that the time here is all I have, and I'll have it
all, but everything hurts. Plus, when I feel like the world wants me
gone, staying is how I spite the world. I had depression for 8 years.
I'm 24. My mum, brother and sister physically attacked me, constantly,
until my early teenage years. I was the youngest sibling. The violence
only stopped when I grew big enough that attacking me was now dangerous
if I chose to retaliate. And I could write a novel on the psychological
damage they inflicted on me. I've been alone for most of my life. Fun
fact, no matter how strong the friendship, EVERYONE you know is capable
of flipping a switch in their head and immediately seeing you as the
lowest form of scum. Even when they ADMIT the other person is the
problem, their actions treat you as the problem. Unless you've seen
someone make a VERY difficult choice, then I promise you, you don't know
them. Not even slightly. They are a complete stranger to you. Don't
believe me? That's fine. You'll learn the same way I did. Give it time.
Due to the above and more, I am dead inside. The only way to stop the
agony is to force myself to feel nothing (mostly works). It made the
depression stop, but it killed almost everything I am emotionally. And
the effort of holding down whatever's left just makes me extremely
stressed all the time. Through sheer will I have enough control these
days to usually prevent panic attacks, but dizzy spells are becoming
more common at work. And when I can't hold it down, I self harm.
Punishing myself makes things make sense. Surely I wouldn't have been
hurt so many times by so many different people unless I deserved it...
right? Rationally I know that's not true. But that lie dulls the pain
inside when it's too much. Hope is a poison and I will never trust
anyone. Never again. So what do I have when my love and hope are dead?
Pain. The only thing strong enough to give me the will to live (and not
just stop eating) and the will to understand this world, is pain. I hate
it, but it's true. Surely someone else who knows what this feels like?
Or am I truly alone?

                    ive been off work for almost 2 months after having a breakdown due to
medication stopping working/ toxic work environment. i was becoming
increasingly suicidal while at work until i got to a point where it was
becoming a real possibility for the first time in years. after a month
or so of time off i started feeling a lot better again but now that its
coming time to actually return to work due to not being able to afford
food rent etc im back to exactly where i was. i cant seem to get any
help from my gp or psychologist about it, keep being told that work
usually helps when you are feeling depressed/suicidal as it can give you
purpose despite me telling them time and time again that in my
experience it does the total opposite. anyway what im asking is how can

                    I’d love to hear other people’s thoughts on how they have dealt with
addictions. I’m a smoker and drinker. I find it very hard to avoid both.
I know smoking is bad but feel it helps me calm. The drinking is worse
in my cause I use it to become numb to feelings and numb myself when
overwhelmed but I usually just spiral out of control when I drink and
become more depressed and suicidal then I already am. any tips would be
appreciated. I am safe look forward to hearing some input.

                    I can't do this stupid life anymore. I just need to write this out.
Because sometimes it has helped me on the past. Just to shout it out on
words. I HATE THIS.. LIFE. The pain keeps happening over and over again.
I cannot deal with it. Tears are in my eyes, frustration, aloneness,
maybe bitterness, I hate that emotion. Just go in the name of Jesus. I
forgive him. It hurts, please heal me. Where does my help come from. The
maker of heaven and earth. I hurt Father God. I hurt.

                    Recently I have separated with my wife of 17 years, she kicked me out of
our house and in 3 weeks I've only been able to see the kids for 1 hr.
By the way I have severe depression. I can't keep friends because of my
self-esteem and negativity so no friends. My mum also has depression and
we are not super close but I have to stay at her house because I
couldn’t sleep in the car any longer. I sit alone in my car or spend
hours kicking the soccer ball at the local pitch because I'm making my
mum really depressed (unintentionally) if I spend to much time with her
and the only other family member I have communication with is my sister
who lives pretty far away and only recently started to form a
relationship but we are total opposites and can't talk to her about
these kind of things. Anyway every night when I get back from work I
have to find somewhere to go and avoid being seen by my wife and her
parents or they get angry and the parents never liked my anyway. I still
love my wife and miss the kids so much. I am really struggling with the
loneliness and my wife has told me a couple of times after we planned
when I could see the kids that for whatever reason the kids can't make
it. So the only thing I have to look forward to keeps getting taken away
and because of my depression and anxiety I think she is lying and I make
things worse. Currently on meds and seeing a psychologist, new to both,
and I know they take time to help with my issues but I am really
struggling to think of anything to give me some kind of hope in the
short term and just have over bearing thoughts of self pity and
loneliness with out hope. I'm having some thoughts about how I could end
it all with out pain and suffering and no chance to get it wrong. I'm
pretty sure I won't act upon these thoughts but the way I am and the way
things are going I'm not so sure I'll feel the same if I keep feeling
this way and I can get stop feeling so alone. I do social soccer once a
week and it helps for 1hr then more loneliness for the rest of the week.
There's more to my negative life but this is my main issue right now.
Any advice or some thoughts of how I can overcome this loneliness and
give me some kind of hope might be life saving. If anyone reads this and
reponds thanks, I may not want to accept anyone's reply but just doing
so helps to easy the pain and know someone cares somewhere.

                    I am 26 years of age. I was diagnosed with Delusional Disorder -
Schizophrenia at age 22.5. Mentally, I am on the decline. I have noticed
that I am not longer as intelligent and as capable of the things that I
previously was capable of doing, such as assignments for adult school.
It has always been a dream of mine to get my certificate of education,
but that dream is slowly slipping out of my hands. I was bullied
relentlessly in mainstream high school over my physical appearance, and
it got to the point where I had no choice but to quit mainstream school
altogether. The teachers and leadership did completely and utterly
nothing about the bullying that I copped from Year 8 to Year 12. I was
an A and B student who used to be very studious. I was the 'perfect
student,' as so a few teachers had labelled me as. I couldn't do it all
anymore - I felt too much pressure to be perfect all the time, and being
hard on myself never helped either. I slowly became a D, E and NA
student. Going back to adult school, I started off pretty well. I went
back up to being an A student again. Then, I met a completely and
utterly awful individual who led me on romantically. He had an ex-wife
on the side who dictated who he could and couldn't date, let alone speak
to. Quite frankly, I believe this man was in a DV relationship with this
woman, and I felt that he was too scared to expose her. He told me
bluntly that, 'whatever medication that I had been taking clearly wasn't
working,' 'I had more issues than previously thought,' 'you're not very
clever,' and he then curled his hands into fists and screamed the word,
'RETARD' in my face. I could be wrong, but I feel that he was being
coached into saying these things. I wanted to cry, because I used to be
very attracted to the man. Well, not anymore. Someone else has come
along and I am not even going to bother with this man because I will
reject him if he dare comes up to me and asks me out on a date. Why
should a delusional, nutcase, schizophrenic with no future ahead of her
go out on a date with a good looking man with a good career? Exactly.
Going back to my health, I am now having problems with my breathing. I
have done some research on this, and COPD is a symptom of Schizophrenia.
I cannot breathe at full capacity anymore. I also always feel dizzy and
sleepy. The Centrelink worker wants me to test my eligibility for the
Disability Support Pension, as I am mentally unfit to work. Why can't I
be normal? And don't tell me that there is no such thing as normal,
because there is.

                    Safety planning involves creating a structured plan – ideally with
support from your health professional or someone you trust – that you
work through when you’re experiencing suicidal thoughts, feelings,
distress or crisis. Your safety plan starts with things you can do by
yourself, such as thinking about your reasons to live and distracting
yourself with enjoyable activities. It then moves on to coping
strategies and people you can contact for support – your friends, family
and health professionals. The safety planning model was developed in the
US by suicide prevention experts Barbara Stanley and Gregory Brown. It
has been used extensively by US veterans’ health organisations, hospital
emergency departments and high schools, and there is strong evidence
that it works. Many health professionals in Australia also use some form
of safety planning to support clients experiencing suicidal thoughts or
feelings, or after a suicide attempt. beyondblue has an app you can use
to create a safety plan, called BeyondNow. The BeyondNow app takes the
principles of safety planning and makes it even easier to use – so
rather than carrying around a piece of paper, you’ve got it on your
phone at all times. It’s free to download from the Apple Store or Google
Play. If you don’t have a smartphone or would prefer to use your desktop
or laptop, BeyondNow is also available to use on our website. Do you

                    I just recently moved back into my mums house because I couldn’t afford
to continue renting while at uni. I had to move back into the room that
my sister was staying in, because she said she wanted to move rooms
anyway. My plan was to move all my stuff before uni started so I wasn’t
trying to do two things at once. I had given my sister over a week to
find a new bed and get it delivered or I would pick it up for her. She
continued to complain about every single bed I put forward. So I ended
up moving her stuff into the front room and shifted my stuff into my
room. This obviously really frustrated her, because now she was without
a bed. But take into consideration that I (countless times) offered up
solutions and she turned every single one down. So after being at my
mums for around 2 days, I was cleaning up after dinner and my sister
yelled at me, “I hope you get off your meds (antidepressants) and kill
yourself”. This was because I put one of her cups into the dishwasher
without asking her first. I didn’t really confront her about what she
said, I just let her sit in the silence after she said it. I found this
horrifying, because out of all the people to say something like this to
me, she would be the last person I expected. She, herself, has had
issues with suicidal ideation and actually tried to commit while in high
school. So this comment from her really shook me to my core. i still
haven’t confronted her about what she said, because i truthfully have no
idea how to react. I am really upset, and this comment has made me feel
unloved and unappreciated in my own home. Has anyone experienced this?
Or does anyone have advice? stella

                    Hi, I am in a situation where I am having trouble coming to an
appropriate decision.My mum is particularly nasty and has narcissistic
tendencies. I feel that her negative behaviours and her predisposition
to make situations about her seem more apparent as time goes on, since
she bought us the property. She was very difficult to be around when I
lived with her and it was detrimental to my wellbeing, but at the moment
I definitely feel happier when I haven’t had much contact with her for a
while.My mum owns the property I live in. I didn’t want her to buy my
sister and I a property but she insisted and often complains about
sacrificing money for the property, saying that she could have kept it
herself, she wants the money back, most parents don’t do this for their
kids and that her mum didn’t help her get a property and blew her money
instead. She will not sell until she feels she will get a good deal on
the property. I am lost about what to do. I want to go no-contact with
my mum. I don’t necessarily have the means to save to purchase my own
property yet since a lot of money has been going towards her and the
property. I find that being around her tends to be unpleasant and she
often invalidates my struggles and makes it about herself.I feel that I
need to be prepared to not receive any money after the property is sold
anyway because my mum as the owner gets to decide where the money goes,
so I don’t want to be in contact with her for the money as it’s not my
priority, I just know that there is going to have to be interaction as a
renter and I don’t want things to get awkward or tense. Also, renting
elsewhere may not be feasible if rent could increase at anytime to the
point where it’s almost impossible to pay, especially as I wouldn’t be
living with other people. I think that I could save for a deposit, but
it would take a while and I don’t want to be abused for much longer.

                    Hey! I’ve got a bit of a complicated situation that I could use some
support I guess on? I’m trans and have been on T for seven months now
and finally got my legal name change, which was a bit of a challenge due
to me living in Australia but being born in the uk. I’m still a minor so
that makes the process even harder. I still am unable to change my legal
sex due to having a uk birth certificate. At the end of this year my
parents and I are going to east Africa. Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya (we
were supposed to go to Ethiopia too but that’s obviously not going to
happen given the situation there). It’s sort of a graduation trip for me
and a trip my dad has been meaning to take given he was born in Kenya
and hasn’t been back since he moved at 5. Anyway I bit of a ramble but
it’s a very meaningful trip and I’ve been really looking forward to it.
However, it’s east Africa and I’m trans. My parents say for my safety I
have to basically live as a girl while I’m there. They’re going to use
they/ them pronouns and people around us will treat me as a girl because
my mum is afraid of complications that if they don’t and people see my
passport with the big ass F on it, my safety will be compromised. I
understand the situation and the safety aspect but at the same time I’m
so angry and sad and frustrated. I finally thought I was done hiding
that now I’m out and on T things would finally be okay and I could be
myself. I want to travel, it’s my one dream and I’m so enraged by how
being trans has limited so much of my life already, I’m only 16, I’ve
wasted at least 5 years in confusion and a false sense of belonging. I
don’t know what to do, I’m definitely going and I wouldn’t change that
for the world but I don’t want to fall back into a cycle of constant
dysphoria and unhealthy coping mechanisms. I’m 50 days clean and the
best I’ve been in years but the thought of having to hide away again and
pretend is really setting me back mentally. I don’t know what to
do.Sorry for this ramble I’m just a bit of a mess over this

                    Hi, I had used to have gay thoughts since around 1 or 2 years back for a
period of time, however I tried to overcome those thoughts by praying to
buddha daily, as I am a Buddhist. Even though I managed to overcome
them, there was this thought that I ever had for a few days, which
indicates that I am destined to be gay. I don't even understand why I
had this thought even though I know that I am not gay, as I had tried to
experiment myself before. It had triggered my panic attacks, as I had
suffered since last year November, when I was preparing for my
university exams, and my panic attack has been there for me ever since.
I even considered seeing a psychologist as I felt that I could not take
it anymore. My panic attack was partly due to stress and it has affected
my social and daily life, as I had suffered from panic attacks now and
then. I ever tried to counter those stress by taking deep breaths and
pray to buddha about it, but it's just that this so-called thought
(destined gay thoughts) was the final turning point that had triggered
my panic attacks, which made me unable to take it anymore, as I tend to
worry a lot unnecessarily. To be honest, I can’t stand being gay now and
then I thought of telling my friend and family about this story, but I
was afraid of being discriminated as they may get the wrong idea. I was
wondering whether it is true that I am destined to be gay. I hope
someone can enlighten me on this please.

                    I've been depressed since I was about 8 years old, officially diagnosed
at 12 and it never went away I'm 22 now. I suffered from abuse during my
childhood and grew up in an unstable and unsupportive household from
both parents, won't go into too much detail as it's uncomfortable to
think about. I don't know, I'm just tired of feeling numb and empty. I
dissociate and feel like I live outside my body, I don't remember things
that happen, days blur together. I'm trying to study nursing so I have
something in the future, but studying is so impossible at the moment,
especially when I can't even get out of bed or shower so I'm barely
scraping by, and only getting attendance through being online in bed. I
have a partner who I live with and he's wonderful, we both struggle with
mental health but it displays very differently for us, so somehow it
sort of gets us functioning in a weird way when we work together if that
makes sense. I try really hard for him, to get better and not show how
much I'm struggling because I know it really impacts his wellbeing when
I'm in my lows. I love him and don't want him to be sad which is why I
haven't done anything yet. I want to try and build a future with him,
and be healthy with him, but everything I try doesn't seem to work. I've
been to many therapists, none of which has actually helped me. I've
tried medication which has actually done more harm than good for me,
I've done every single mindfulness, meditation, art, music therapy,
hobbies which I can't seem to find interest in anything. I've even
dabbled into spirituality because I was so desperate for something, but
I just can't believe in it. I feel so bad, and want him to be okay, but
I'm worried I won't be able to stop myself from negative thougths; if I
continue like this for much longer. sorry if this was a complete
nightmare to read, my thoughts are running everywhere and I just needed

                    Hey just felt like I needed to get this out there somewhere. For the
past 8 years I’ve been suffering with anxiety and depression and the
only thing I can think about is killing myself. I know that my mental
illness is not my fault as it runs in my family but this does not make
me feel any better. I have tried so hard to rid myself of these feeling
yet no matter how hard I try nothing works. I’ve been to counselling
which didn’t help, I’ve change jobs, tried making new friends, doing
exercise pretty much any sort of help that is recommended yet nothing
seems to change. I am so tired and have lost any and all hope that I
will get better. I’ve isolated myself from my family and friends as I am
tired of putting up a front and do not enjoy doing anything anymore. I
am so lost and feel as if I am out of options. The only choices I see
left are to either keep living feeling like this or to end my life. I
know that my family care about me and would be upset if I ended my life
but this does not make me feel any better, if anything it makes me feel
worse knowing that I have to suffer for the sake of other people’s
wellbeing.

                    Hi BBers, I think I may have schizophernia. It runs in the family and I
have not been able to get my act together for a few years now. Can
anyone recommend a GOOD physician? OMD.

                    I attempted suicide last week, and am okay physically now after a
hospital stay, but now i dont know what to do. My partner of 9 years has
been very distressed by the attempt and is unsure if he wants to
continue our relationship. I don't know how to cope with him leaving me
when it feels like i need him and the stability of our relationship more
than ever right now.

                    I'm suffering from chronic pain issues; auto immune related issues and a
body that is basically falling apart. I have no family around except for
a brother (and sister in law,and niece), who would rather spend time
with their friends - even though I pushed myself to be there for their
daughters birthday. My teeth are rotting because of pain meds and I have
no way of paying for them to be fixed.. some are now are in my smile
line and the idea of loosing teeth there destroys me. My extended family
wanted me to join them on Christmas day except for the fact it would be
just breakfast as they want to visit their significant others family
(not to mention it's a 4 hour round trip for me on public transport on a
public holiday), and I can barely function as I'm suffering from
tinnitus and vertigo at the moment on top of my usual health issues. I'm
struggling to get through to the rest of the year. I've been reaching
out via text message to my closest friend - but he's been avoiding me.
My other friend just doesn't believe how bad my mental state is; despite
having her own issues with depression and suicide. Every year is another
year where nothing is achieved and my ""bucket list"" is further away from
ever happening. Even on the rare occasions I'm out socializing; people
avoid me. I seem to just repel people. Having had years and years of
people leaving me, it's not like I haven't tried - organizing parties at
my place; inviting friends out for a girls night out etc... no one ever
bothers returning the favor. No one checks up on me. My online friends
only respond to me messaging them - and even that's not a guarantee of a
reply. I'm tired of struggling with no support. I'm not living, I'm
barely surviving. .. it's like I'm not even here. And I'm sure it
wouldn't matter if I wasn't because people in my life just don't seem to
care! And it's not like I have anything keeping me here - no partner, no
kids, no pets. . Nothing at all.

                    I am a wife, mum of two (2+4), and I work 2 jobs. I struggled a lot with
becoming a mum. I'm certainly not a naturally maternal person. I am
independent, I love learning, I'm smart (probably the only thing about
myself I am confident in), and I like to achieve goals... So when my
days were reduced to changing nappies and getting small people to sleep
... I was not in a good way. I felt like my whole identity got ripped
away. Anyway, as soon as I fell pregnant with the first, my husband
totally lost interest in me sexually. That hasn't changed. I could count
on one hand how many times we've been intimate in the last 6-12 months.
He struggles with what I am 99% sure is ADHD. He is very carefree (to
the point of not noticing massive dangers sometimes) and I am quite risk
averse... Which obviously causes some tension in regards to the kids.
Prior to kids it was never really an issue - because his decisions
didn't really impact anyone else... But now they impact the kids, and I
won't not advocate for what I think is best for the kids... So tension
often follows - as does the trope around me being ""irrational""
""impossible"" ""crazy"" ""insane"" etc etc. Don't get me wrong, we have fun
times too. And I love my husband... But having kids has made things
impossible. It's gotten to the point where if I raise ANYTHING that he
disagrees with he will start the ""I can never do anything right"" script.
I inevitably have to become the fun police (a role I hate being forced
to play), and he reiterates how ""exhausting"" my ""negative energy"" is. I
have had these kids, and I don't like mothering. I'm not good at
mothering. They've wrecked our marriage. They destroyed my body so no
one else will love me. I can't leave, because I can't bear the thought
of someone else raising them... So I'm just stuck. I'm stuck living this
hollow life where I can't even advocate for my kids and do the best I
can as a mother (which is already not great). I just feel totally
trapped. I feel like I'm shouldering the responsibility on my own.I feel
like the only way out of it all is to leave permanently. I don't want
this anymore I don't want to be here anymore.

                    I don’t know what to do. Nothing helps, and I’ve been to many different
therapists, been on every antidepressant/mood stabilisers, psych ward,
hospital, you name it. All since age 14 and I’m almost 26. Recently been
told by a trauma therapist that I have CPTSD. I have so much trauma and
trust issues that I just isolate and don’t go anywhere. Especially since
I had to move back with family due to my flatmate that put me in danger.
Gave up alcohol, just ended up depending on other substances. Trying to
sort EMDR but I honestly have no hope. Every day I beg the universe to

                    Hello, the other night my 18 year old son attempted to take his life.
This is his third suicide attempt that I know of. He says leading up to
the episodes he hears voices in his head. They make him scared and he
runs. The voices seem to be triggered by alcohol and/or a fight with his
ex-girlfriend who he can’t let go of. She taunts him, takes him back one
night, then ghosts him the next. Last weekend, he caught his friend in
bed together which triggered the latest attempt. She sends nudes to her
ex, then takes my son back into her bed. He took a job in another state
and looked forward to a new start, but she followed him there. I have
just driven hours to bring him home. He can’t see what she’s doing to
him and still loves her. It’s like he’s obsessed. What’s worse is the
times he feels the strength to make a break from the ex, he gets
messages from her sister. He’s on depression meds but we are organising
a psychiatrist to review him and re-think meds/diagnoses. I wonder if
anyone has experience in how to cope with this kind of thing?

                    Safety planning involves creating a structured plan – ideally with
support from your health professional or someone you trust – that you
work through when you’re experiencing suicidal thoughts, feelings,
distress or crisis. Your safety plan starts with things you can do by
yourself, such as thinking about your reasons to live and distracting
yourself with enjoyable activities. It then moves on to coping
strategies and people you can contact for support – your friends, family
and health professionals. The safety planning model was developed in the
US by suicide prevention experts Barbara Stanley and Gregory Brown. It
has been used extensively by US veterans’ health organisations, hospital
emergency departments and high schools, and there is strong evidence
that it works. Many health professionals in Australia also use some form
of safety planning to support clients experiencing suicidal thoughts or
feelings, or after a suicide attempt. beyondblue has an app you can use
to create a safety plan, called BeyondNow. The BeyondNow app takes the
principles of safety planning and makes it even easier to use – so
rather than carrying around a piece of paper, you’ve got it on your
phone at all times. It’s free to download from the Apple Store or Google

                    Hi I'm Cindy and I am posting in here because I didn't know where else
to post this. I am suffering from what I believe is Benign Fasciculation
Disorder. It is an unknown disorder with what looks to be no treatment
or no recovery (it will either go away, or it won't). It's a 'harmless'
disorder that consists of twitching of the muscles 24/7. It might not be
considered harmful but it is mentally draining, annoying and prevents me
from sleeping at night with non-stop twitching. I've had this for 7
weeks now, insidious onset. No idea why it started. Doctors can't help
me. I've had blood tests and my blood levels are fine. I am not
Magnesium or other minerals deficient. They don't think it's MS or ALS.
They say I'm 100% healthy. Doctors perscribe muscle relaxants to 'stop'
the twitching at night but I'd rather not take them as they cause
addiction, depression and other unwanted side affects. I have no idea if
Anxiety, physical activity, stress etc causes it or if it just 'does
it'. Some days it lets me sleep at night, other times it doesn't. I live
day to day in fear of whether or not I'm going to get a good night's
sleep. If I feel a twitch I panic. If I don't get a good nights sleep my
mental health drops. I become hopeless and have thoughts of suicide.
Hopelessness being ""well no-one knows what it is, no-one can cure me, I
might be like this forever. No one knows, no-one can relate, there's no
hope, what's the point?"" I'm trying Physio at the moment but even the
Physio can only guess. I'm doing all these exercises which I think are
not helping. They are just causing twitching in other areas of my body
that I didn't have before. Now I have back discomfort from it. Yes it
stopped a bunch of twitching in the knee area of my thigh, but now other
areas of the same thigh are twitching. I'm here to find out if there are
others with this condition and if so, what do you do at night to help
you sleep through the twitching? I can deal with it throughout the day
but not at night. I need to sleep!

I’ve been with her a year now and she has made me so happy until she
only recently mentioned that she had slept with someone else at the
beginning of the relationship which I had since forgiven her from as she
stayed up all night explaining herself to me 3 days ago I found out that
she had been talking to around 10 other guys that had all asked her for
nudes or made sexual comments about her and I confronted her about this
I told her how much she had hurt me and her response was that she had no
idea that I would have a problem with that and that it was normal she
has been talking to me all day today but nothing at all on the first day

growing older, what i’m going to do with my life, scared of ending up
alone. I just can’t imagine feeling like this for the rest of my life
and i have been thinking about suicide a lot lately, i dont think i
would ever do it because i have lots of siblings and I would never do
anything to hurt them, but constantly thinking about wanting to be dead
is so draining, but i truly do not know how to help myself. I feel like
such a loser, go to work, come home, rot in bed playing videos games,
repeat, I feel like im not doing enough. I try and eat enough food, i
tried to exercise, i tried meditation and positive affirmations and I
just end up slipping back into old habits. Im a broke uni student, i
live at home but i pay for my own necessities, i cannot afford to
regularly see a therapist.

                    Im in my mid 30s. Been struggling with panic attacks and suicidality
since primary school. Im desperatley lonely but phobic of dating. I have
SI since I was 8. I have periods of stability then a crash - I
re-stabalise at a lower level of functionality. It has gotten to the
point where I am agraphobic. I also have suspected cptsd and autism
spectrum disorder. I have emetephobia. I have done cbt, a full dbt out
patient course, tried countless meds but I just keep getting worse. I'm
so tired of trying. Of forcing myself to get up, to eat, to go outside,
to shower. I can barely work. I feel like a burden and although I have
tried I can't go through with suicide. I feel trapped in a nightmare I
can't wake up from. I know I am privilaged. I live with a degree of
financial security. I have a roof over my head, Caring friends and pets.
But I do not know what to do. I have had multiple hospitalisations. I
just want the fear to go away. It is always there. The adults I felt
close too have all died. I often want to join them but I can't do it. I
used to be able to do so much more. Everything is getting harder. Im
scared of what my next step down will look like. Take care anyone
reading this. Know you are loved - even by a random on the interwebs -
and kindness is our only hope.

                    Hi, im trying to breathe calmly right now. I’m already going through a
very difficult time with severe chronic pain for the last 4 years, and
recently being forced o rely on certain family members I tried to get
away from. I found out half an hour ago from my older cousin that my
eldest brother told him (when they were about 17) that my other brother
(then 15) had molested one of us girls. Tonight my cousin asked if it
was me. I was shocked because I didn’t know this happened at all. I
struggled greatly living at home with my brother (accused of molesting
my sister) as he has Scizophrenia and the sick, psychotic nature of his
illness was always my problem. My other sister moved out and got
pregnant young. My oldest brother left at 17, and I was trying to
study/work and hopefully do law but the environment was so unhealthy I
didn’t do well. My parents always worked. They were never home…always
using money to compensate for them not being there. I put a lock on my
own door to protect myself. but my anger now comes from finding out that
my brother at 17 and onwards… never tried to protect me or my sister. He
also found out dad was having an affair and didn’t tell Mum because Dad
said it would ruin the business/money that my Brother no doubt benefited
from. He is still the golden child. Im suicidal to the point I have a
plan. I feel sick with the blood that runs through my veins. I have been
suicidal for over a year due to physical pain. Now, the year long
triggers regarding my mother, father, brothers….makes me feel constantly
worthless. No amount of mirror work, meditation, journaling helps now,
because I’m stuck being supported by the only people that make me feel
that way. I can’t manage on my own. Even with community support, it’s
not enough. My life is physical hell and I’m physically stuck in it.
It’s a special kind of torture.

                    I am grateful for the suicide call back service. I see their number all
the time but today I had the courage to call them. I have been
spiralling down since last December and trying to cope alone. I hate to
rely on my children. But my son didn’t answer or reply this morning, so
I called someone else. A complete stranger. Someone who makes themselves
available on a Sunday morning to help total strangers like me to
basically stay alive for another day. My darling son did eventually
reply to me and I told him that I would be ok now. I hate to burden him
with this. I love and appreciate him so much. I want to stay for him and
I want to see him thrive. He deserves better. I am trying to be better
for him and he is keeping me going for now. I know that if I go now,
this would cause him so much distress and stress. I love him so dearly.
He’s the kindest sweetest person that I’ve ever known. Just pure good.
People like him deserve so much more and so much better. He’s an amazing
young man. I so wished that I had half the goodness and courage and
compassion that he possesses. I have such a throbbing headache from
crying since 8am this morning and I can’t seem to stop it. My eyes are
so sore from the tears. I am going to be a wreck tomorrow for work. But
I am going to struggle through this post and take it one day, one hour
as it comes. That’s all I can manage at this moment. Take care beautiful
people. And call someone if you feel the need

with painful emotions I turn to self halm or suicide.I found I was
always judged my Ed staff, ambulance staff, police, It makes it hard to
reach out. Once I push ( not physically) my children away I have a
tendency to jump in my car and self halm. If no relieve I then tempt
suicide . I'm sitting here the last 2 days with strong urges, thoughts
popping up randomly.I would love for this pain to be gone for good. But
then my kids would feel pain. Living in this torture is horriable. I
feel scared ever thought that impulse will take over and I will act. I
feel judgement from medical professionals, embarrassed, ashamed and
disappointed that I can't just make it stop. I'm looking for hope and

                    I always have thoughts of suicide after I argue with my husband. We are
both very sensitive and so arguments happen often. They escalate quickly
and every time I just feel like killing myself almost like a form of
revenge. To show him how lost he would be without me, what kind of life
he would have without me, how he would suffer without me. The feeling is
so strong with every argument that I feel like one day I will go ahead
with it. What always stops me is the kids. I can't do it to them and
leave them motherless. I tried therapy, meditation, creatrix,
everything...but nothing has really been a long lasting help. I hate
this cycle. Just wondering if others feel the same way. Thanks for

time. there's lots of reasons i got depressed, it'd take too long to
explain it all but as a general rule i've cry'd almost everyday for the
last 10ish years, i've planned my suicide at least 1000 times by now, i
don't have energy for hobbies or loved ones. i'm very tired. As a rule,
just as life starts getting good for me, everything always falls apart.
I have a partner, they make me ""happy,"" but something still feels very
wrong with my existance. I'm not really okay, i'm not really happy. The
main thing that really kept me alive this long was telling myself if i
work hard and save up things will be okay one day. i'll be able to
afford a nice home and go on nice holidays etc. the struggle will be
worth it. i finally save up enough to go on a holiday, covid hits and we
can't travel. i save up enough to buy a house, prices go through the
roof and i can't afford anything any more. Everyone says prices will go
down so i save up and wait. but they don't come down, the supply is
dwindling, the only thing left is small units hours from work and i'm
just tired of it all. Whats the point of working hard if theres never a
happy ending to it. whats the point of spending 12 hours of my day
paying taxes to then spend the rest of it crying and stressing about the
future. Everyone else seems to have bought a house at the right time,
gone on holiday's at the right time, found a fun hobby but the right
time never seems to come for me. it's like my existance is cursed. I was
born decades too late. i'm nearly half way through my natural life and
it all feels like a waste, it's just constant suffering. I was finally
starting to see an upside then the housing and cost of living crisis
hits and i'm just done. Am i just entitled and needs to get over
themself? does anyone else feel this way too?

                    I would like to think I would never commit suicide really, I’ve got two
children that are my sole responsibility but when I get really
distressed like I was last night, I fantasise myself doing it and slowly
drifting away and the relief and end to the pain, even how I would do it
with what is in my immediate surroundings. So I guess that’s suicide
ideation. The only reason I hold back is my two children that are my
sole responsibility. I feel so helpless , I can’t make anything better
and I also can’t escape. Recently I just feel there’s no one I can talk
to anymore. I’ve been in a bad state of depression most of the last year
and I’m that time I’ve drifted away from people and been socially
avoidant. I also don’t get any time away from my kids and they hate
spending time away from me and usually guilt trip me when I try and do
anything without them. I know I need a change of meds and some more
therapy but just so hard to sort out . Just feel I need to talk about it
with someone before I completely lose the plot .

                    Hi all, I haven't been here in a while. I'm getting no where. And
honestly, I'm at the end of my tether. I've done all the thing people
say to do - I've reached out, I try to do self care, seek therapy, use
healthy coping strategies... but nothing seems to work. I've been pushed
between countless mental health professionals and GP's because they say
they can't help me. I'm SO exhausted. It feels like I can't escape this
feeling of hopelessness. It's crushing me, its like this heavy weight on
my shoulders that prevents me from being happy. Between juggling an
eating disorder, depression, anxiety, OCD, self harm and suicidal
thoughts for so long, it just doesn't work. I want to make the pain
stop. I need it to stop. I need it to all go away. Not long ago, I was
close to attempting to take my own life, and the thing that stopped me
was literally that I numbed out and being unable to physically move my
body. I just sat there for an hour. In hindsight, I'm glad that happened
so that I didn't do anything I would regret, but there's a part of me
that still wishes I was gone, that the countless near misses had been
plans followed thru. It's so confusing though. I don't know if i want to
die. I am safe from these thoughts tonight, I just need a space to
express them. Sending much love to everyone out there struggling, you
are not alone<3

                    I am currently really struggling, I feel I need to write this down cause
I’ve never been great at expressing myself. I am feeling broken,
betrayed. There’s just so much pain and it seems there is no light at
the end of the tunnel. Haven’t been able to sleep or eat, I feel heavy
and the burden seems too much to bear right now . I’m trying to stay
positive but these thoughts just get stronger every hour of every day

                    I’d rather speak on here than to a friend or family member. My suicidal
thoughts began a year ago, linked to several surgeries involving
malpractice and bad luck, surrounded with betrayal from a past partner
and being kicked out of the house and back to my home state, with
nowhere to live and no job, with health issues. My physical health won’t
be the same. Not a moment in my day exists without physical pain. I’m
nobody’s priority. Sometimes ppl say… oh, well you look good…you’re
smart, and still have your looks at 41… and somehow ppl think that has
any effect on my physical pain. I think some ppl look at slim,
attractive women and think they have no problems. My pain is physical
and it can’t be seen. I can’t wear shoes, or go barefoot so I lay or sit
most of the time. I had a procedure a few days ago and the anaesthetic
is no doubt causing depression which I don’t normally feel. I feel sad,
or pain, or ptsd traits like nightmares but not depression. Not like
this. The last person who betrayed me contacted me yesterday and the
timing is leaving me in a spiral, where I have gone through the motions
of how I will end things. I tell myself… if a pink rose appears on the
tv in the next 2 scenes, I won’t do it. I wish I could find a reason to
stay.. hope…hope for my health that something can be done. But ive lost
my ability to exercise, take care of myself, work, and lost the chance
of a family and possibly a relationship…ever. And that’s a life I can’t
see me living. I need a miracle.

                    2023 was a very dark year for me, mentally & emotionally. Suicidal
thought have been occurring more frequently over the past 4 months & I
literally prepared to do it, but, the ONLY thing that has stopped me is
what it will do to my parents. I recently found out dad has a heart
condition. I know it would probably kill him if I was to follow through,
which would absolutely destroy my mum. I don't want to do that to them,
but there's also the thought in my mind that I cannot continue to live
this way. These thoughts make me start to resent my parents, who are the
most loving, caring & beautiful parents anyone could hope for. I have so
much pain, anger, guilt, despair & resentment, on top of the constant
anxiety, depression, stress & nothingness that it am so drained of
wanting to be here anymore. I have seen a therapist, but in the last few
months I have 'put on an act' to make it seem like I'm coping a little
better, just small improvements each time so it doesn't feel like I'm
faking it. But honestly, I am so done with everything.

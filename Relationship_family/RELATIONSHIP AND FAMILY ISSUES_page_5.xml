                 Hi everyone, The Relationships &amp; Family Issues section is one of the
busiest here on our forums. It's also one of the areas where we find
members can get themselves into trouble! Before posting here, take a
deep breath and be mindful of the following...

                 Hi everyone, The Relationships &amp; Family Issues section is one of the
busiest here on our forums. It's also one of the areas where we find
members can get themselves into trouble! Before posting here, take a
deep breath and be mindful of the following 3 tips: 1. Do you really
want to share this with the world? This is a public forum. Are you
thinking of posting something that could identify you to a friend or
family member? Once you've posted, you can't delete what you've written
and we don't take posts down from here unless they've broken one of our
community rules. This is because our members spend a lot of time
composing replies, and there is a much wider audience that gets a lot
out of reading what has been written. It's not fair to ask the community
for support, then ask to have it removed once you've read it so others
can't also benefit. Use discretion when posting here - think about the
level of detail you are sharing, and think also about who might know you
are posting here. Also, please keep it clean: this is an all ages forum
and explicit discussions about sexual problems are not permitted.
Threads and posts of this nature will be removed and your account placed
on a moderation hold. 2. What do you want to get out of posting here?
Relationship and family issues are stressful. Members sometimes post
here seeking advice about a relationship that has broken down, but find
themselves getting upset when they don't agree with the response they
get. This is a peer support forum, meaning we are not mental health
professionals. We are people of all ages and backgrounds, with a wide
range of life experiences. While we aim for our discussions to be
conducted respectfully, people here will respond with the truth as they
see it, from their own experiences and perspectives. We are not here to
take sides. Offence is almost never intentional, but it can be sometimes
taken. The advice you will see here is not intended to be a substitute
for professional counselling. 3. What other support do you have? Most
people posting on our forums (about any issue) use this space as a
supplement to other supports. This forum is not and cannot be a
substitute for offline supports, but it is often a good place to start
the ball rolling and find the courage for seeking help. If you are
relying solely on an internet forum to resolve your relationship or
family issues, you are likely to be disappointed. Check out the Healthy
Homes section of our Healthy Families website for further information
and resources.

                 I became a victim of a most serious crime. It was a life changing event.
No fault of my own. Not my husband. It happened in my private life. I
was the 3rd victim. As a result I became ill with major reactive
depression cptsd. Anxiety. My husband told police "he was not returning
to see what was left of his wife". He also told police "shoot her she
won't be able to live with what happened". He was defence service. I
have 3 older brothers, all professional people.1 said "fluff off I'm
busy." Another said " I'm sorry what happened to you but you are no
longer family dont come to my home near my family I'll call the police."
My eldest said "im not comming back you choose to live like this and
look what you are doing to mum and dad". Well that was 35yrs ago. Mum
and dad were aged and wonderful as my uncles. And aunt. Sadly now all
deceased. I returned to my career. After loosing everything and was
transferred to public housing. It is family shame but mum and dad said
anything can be a home. They helped with cleaning gardening and
maintenance. I am so grateful to have a home. 2 of my brothers wives are
deceased and they didn't tell me. I sent flowers to funerals. Christmas
cards over the years. No response. I have retired due to physical
health, rare untreatable cancer. I am alone and hide from society where
I can. I am getting my personal affairs in order and my brothers adult
children are looked after from my estate.I will have no funeral. I have
2 good cousins and a best friend.My home is small lovely and peaceful. I
still hurt when the dark days are looming. I feel I am nothing. Then
dark thoughts. It is my responsibility not to act on them. There is no
help out there. Beyond blue has a good ice app and articles.My own
family . I am so below them because I live in housing.I have a mental
illness. I do on occasion interect with 1 brother, he can be rude and
his 3rd wife is nasty. He allows this and is very cruel, thinking he is
funny. He never asks how I am.We only make contact family business. We
all grew up together Weddings 21st births family Christmas. Family
holidays.Has anyone else been treated like this? Over 35 years. Honesy
if it wasn't for my 2 sheepdogs I won't be here. But it is a beautiful
world.I am now 62. No support but a oncologist and good GP. When I was
in danger the police were inappropriate and medical staff were non
sympathetic. I remember their comments and treatment.Thankyou for
listening. Please know " I tried to make it right". I feel an outcast
and unworthy. It is my secret. Especially from work.I am a retired
general nurse of 43yrs. Nurses are never to break.But we do. I can only
talk of this because I am retired.Blessings to each and every one of
you. Again thankyou for listening. J.

                 Hi, I have been married for 25 years and i thought our life together was
pretty perfect. We spend lots of time together going for walks, going
out for dinners and shows and going on mini-holidays often. 8 months ago
i discovered he had starting engaging in online sex chats. He assured me
it was just chats, photos and one potential meetup that he thought
better of and cancelled.I was absolutely devastated and in shock.
However he has now admitted that he had sex with 2 of those women, (i
suspect there were probably more that he hasn't admitted to). This was
even more unbelievable to me. I begged for honesty back then and he
continued to lie to me, although i understand he didnt want to own up to
more as it would surely break us up. As bad as i feel I could almost
move past this as it was months ago and could think of it as a once off
mistake. However i also just found out he resubscribed to the sex site
again a few weeks ago and was heading in the same direction again,
spending money for photos, gifts and looking at bars for meet ups. I
also found out that he has met up with a couple of women from the gym
for coffees, platonic at this point, but of course they are single women
and im sure they would think he wants more and he obviously knows its
wrong as this was also kept a secret from me.Now that this has been
exposed he knows i really might leave him now and he is desperate to do
anything to stop that happening. We have just started couples
counselling to try to get an understanding as to why it happened and to
help me decide whether to stay or break up.He would be distraught if our
young adult children ever found out.I always thought that cheating would
be a deal breaker for me and it would be an easy decision, however in
reality its not that easy.The problem is that i really love him and i
loved our life together and just want things to go back to the way they
were, but dont think we can ever be the same again and struggle to see
at the moment how we could even be somewhat happy again.I hate the
thought of ending everything after 25 years, selling the house,
upsetting the family, being on my own etc...Its all so sad and daunting.
The easiest option is to carry on, but obviously with new conditions.Is
there anyone out there with a similar experience who has stayed and made
it work?Thanks for reading my story.

about how to address his behaviour. It's tearing us apart. I called in
sick from work today, for the first time ever in my life due to the
anxiety I am feeling.I feel like I've failed as a parent.I don't have
anyone to speak with.I feel so low that I an no longer communicative at
home.I wish somehow that I could be a source of encouragement; comfort
for him... but he is angry with me, and he doesn't want to do anything
with me.For now, he still comes home; but I feel that will change for
the worse in the coming weeks. It's like seeing a train wreck unfold and
being powerless to stop it. I don't know what to do.

                 I'm just needing a bit of advice as to what to do with this. I have been
very close friends with this person for around 3 years now. A few weeks
ago, it was their birthday, and a few days later was their party. I woke
up the morning of their party with a migraine aura (my warning sign that
I'm about to get one), body aches and a sore throat. I took some
medicine and had plenty of water and rest, but about an hour later it
was getting worse. I was so upset, I was crying and telling my mum that
I still want to go, and she told me that realistically, I wouldn't last
very long. I took a covid test, negative, but I genuinely was not well.
I was too sick and upset to message them, so I got my mum to calls
theirs. Then I don't hear anything from them for two weeks. At the
moment I'm really struggling with my mental health, my dog just passed
away, and I'm also very socially isolated due to me being homeschooled.
They know all of this, they also know that they are my only friend. I
messaged them a few times over the two weeks, no reply. Then yesterday I
asked if they were upset with me, and it turns out that they felt very
disrespected because I didn't contact them directly on the day of their
party. They seem really pissed off, and I felt really bad initially, but
I literally couldn't open my eyes unless I was in a pitch black room
because of the migraine, they knew this. Then they ignored me whilst I
was talking about how lonely I am, and how much I need to spend some
time with them. Am I in the wrong? I am genuinely really annoyed with
them and I'm wondering if this friendship is worth continuing. This has
absolutely destroyed me and I've been crying pretty much constantly
since they told me.

                 I have been with my partner almost 25 years. We are not married and have
2 children. We live in a house owned by his parents, and our rent is
very reasonable. My partner has been running his own business from
downstairs for 7 years, but has never earned enough to pay tax. I have
casual work, but have primarily been a stay at home Mum whilst our
children were young. My partner slipped a disc in his back 4 years ago
and was totally incapacitated for 6 months, leaving me to do everything,
and I mean everything. Being a sole trader he did not receive any
financial suport whilst his back was buggered, he couldn’t even drag
himself to the toilet, I was emptying containers of pee for months.
Anyway, fast forward to now, his back is better, but his business has
not picked up and he has done nothing to try and get more clients. He
barely earns $250 a week most weeks. We are surviving on tiny government
handouts and I am at my wits end. I am looking for a second job. My
frustrations are these: Despite being well enough now to work, he does
nothing to try and help himself. Running a business is hard, but he is
not putting in the effort. He does zero advertising, does not hustle to
find more clients at all. He has no website, nor is he saving to try and
build one. I do all his invoicing and responding to emails that will sit
there if I do not. He doesn’t seem to have any motivation at all. When
he hurt his back his parents gave him a repreive from paying rent, but I
have still been paying my share… but there is no end in sight. They have
not given him a deadline as to when they want the money back, and I feel
that it’s unfair that I am struggling to pay, when he is not. 4 years it
has been this way. Aside from the injury he’s had other ongoing back
issues most of his life and we have never shared a bed as he can’t sleep
in one because it hurts his back. So every night I go to bed alone. I’m
sure you can see what this has done to our sex life – it is
non-existent. I am lonely and tired of this situation. Despite having no
money, nor paying any rent he smokes cigarettes and weed and manages to
find money for those. I do not feel I can rely on him financially at
all. I pay for all the children’s expenses, laptops, school needs etc…
If an unexpected bill pops up, I have to deal with it alone, or his
Mother swoops in to give him money. I feel he is taking advantage of his
parents and me. I have tried discussing the sleeping arrangements and
even bought a new, harder mattress for us but he still does not use it
or come to bed. He sleeps in an office chair all night falling asleep
after playing video games, or sleeps on a roll mat on the floor of his
studio downstairs. I sleep in our bedroom upstairs. His sleeping
patterns are all over the shop, often he stays up until 4am and then
sleeps until midday or until he has a client. He often falls asleep in
front of the TV. It feels like he is disinterested in me and our family.
We have no plans for our future, neither holidays, buying a house
together nor general future discussion. I feel more like flatmates with
children rather than a couple with mutual desires. Is it time to walk
away or can this be fixed? Thank-you

                 Hi all, I have a bit of an odd situation - l am a 21 y.o and have a
pretty bad deep relationship with my mum. As of late, my relationship
with my mum has really taken a turn for the worse. She is always taking
what l say to heart (e.g she was discussing how work was bothering her
and l made a joke about it which was meant to be funny, but she took it
as me mocking her situation). I also decided not to go to her place due
to some emotional issues and she took this as me punishing her for
something that had happened. I even sent her flowers as a gesture, and
she didn't care to appreciate them or my intent. Whenever l come to her
place, l feel like l am walking on eggshells and that if l say the wrong
thing, she will take offence. She is also HUGE on me not being able to
show empathy (l can show it for some situations l have been in, but not
so much for her, l don't know why) and berates me for this and chalks it
up to me "not caring" about her/it being a lack of care factor. This is
absolutely not the case, l just cannot empathise with certain
situations. With my dad, l feel as if l am able to be more free and
do/so whatever l like (use sarcasm, be funny, tell jokes that he gets
and understands and talk more about my struggles in the neurotypical
world than with my mum) and she takes this as me favouring him. She also
tries to say that she is autistic since she relates to one or two
problems that l mention l face, which is just incredibly annoying to
belittle my experience. This relationship with her has been mostly me
bending to her will over the past few years (essentially since l was 7)
and has left me feeling quite drained and not happy. We have our happy
moments here and there, and l know she does love and care for me, but l
don't know if l can continue dealing with her constantly bringing up
issues about me (since l am who l am and l don't feel like l need to
change anything just to suit one person). When l was a lot younger and
after my parents divorce, she would always go out and get drunk and l
would have to try to take care of her. She is also dating someone who is
NOT good for her own mental health (issues l will not go in to) and
displays deep levels of narcissism. Although over the years she has
improved, l still feel as if l cannot be my true self around her since
she does not appreciate it and thinks my true self is rude or has
behavioural issues. Not exactly sure what l'm asking for here, but any
advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

                 Hi everyone, Feeling like I have been on a rollercoaster for the last 10
days and trying to make sense of everything, including my emotions.
Started Monday a week ago when, remembering hubby had told me the day
before he had a Christmas email from friends of ours, I picked up his
iPad to see what they had to say. All the usual Christmas catchup, what
children were doing etc. then I saw the email next to it. With the first
line of conversation showing. “I love you”. I asked for an explanation
obviously and all that happened was he grabbed the iPad off me and
muttered it was nothing, just someone he was talking to online that he
had met on Instagram. I looked her up - she is a 29 year old blonde who
is everything I’m not. And he is more than twice that age and I am
50...was 50...51 today! He refused to tell me anymore so I packed a bag
and went to Mum’s. The following day I came home, he still wouldn’t
talk, so I threw him out instead. Each subsequent day we tried to talk
and the story expanded from ‘absolutely nothing that wasn’t general chit
chat’, to ‘have developed feelings for her’. I logged into his account
and started trawling (he uses one of two passwords for everything which
isn’t bright if you are cheating). By the end of the week I had found 7
girls, and he admitted to online sex chats, exchange of naked photos
etc. but what really hurt was that every time he told me something, he
swore I now knew everything (I kept insisting I needed honest
disclosure). So, bottom line from him is that because they never touched
in person it wasn’t so bad and that he has been honest because he didn’t
lie in his responses, just didn’t tell me anything I didn’t directly ask
- that withholding information is not lying. I didn’t eat for 5 days and
vomited even water back up. Now I just feel numb with intermittent bouts
of extreme emotion where all I can do is sit and let the pain wash over
me. The timing wasn’t great. In those 10 days have been an anniversary
(26 years), New Years, and my birthday. Which isn’t helping at all. I
had no idea this was happening, I have never even checked his Facebook
posts before, never bothered to see who he followed on Instagram, never
looked at his email (prob why he wasn’t worried about the password
thing). I went crazy after this, logging into everything, trying to find
out what I could. Eventually I realised that this was both unhealthy and
that he had started to cover his trail by deleting everything... Sorry,
for dumping!

together at work but also talking after work, as well as texting all
night and going out together before and after work. I'm in a long term
relationship and knew he was off limits in that sense but I always saw
him as a close bff and actually liked the idea of having such a close
guy friend I could talk to. But, as the year progressed and I learnt
more about him and his personal life. I realised whenever I got too
close he would shut me out and tried to turn the situation into me being
manipulative and would tell me I was always so negative, even when I was
being supportive or thought I was joking with a friend who knew I was
there for them. In the end this turned into a whorl wind of emotions for
both of us. I was seeing my psych and learning how to support our
personalities, by either being friends or colleagues but not both
because it became too tricky as he thought talking to me reminded him of
work. At the same time, he was doing similar but decided to avoid
working together to support both of us in understanding each other and
he cut me off one day through text after work. Safe to say I was a wreck
and never received an explanation from him. After that, he would
continue to avoid it and would only talk to me in a work capacity until
he left abruptly and got a new job. I have anxiety and am new to
understanding how to handle it. But this situation has never happened to
me before and my anxiety makes me feel lonely sometimes when I think
about what we used to have but also makes me feel like I did something
wrong. I can't help but feel like it all fell apart because of me. It's
been 6 months now since we 'split' and he is still on my mind, making me
think I could have done something earlier to save the situation. I have
accepted his decision and that was fine but it's the feeling of not
being able to talk about it that keeps me dwelling on this. Can anyone
give me ideas of how to move on from dwelling on 'if it was me' feeling?
I'm 35 and I've never experienced anyone like this before and find
myself completely confused. I feel like such a bad person sometimes
because I never got an answer.

                 Hi everyone, The Relationships &amp; Family Issues section is one of the
busiest here on our forums. It's also one of the areas where we find
members can get themselves into trouble! Before posting here, take a
deep breath and be mindful of the following...

                 Hi everyone, The Relationships &amp; Family Issues section is one of the
busiest here on our forums. It's also one of the areas where we find
members can get themselves into trouble! Before posting here, take a
deep breath and be mindful of the following 3 tips: 1. Do you really
want to share this with the world? This is a public forum. Are you
thinking of posting something that could identify you to a friend or
family member? Once you've posted, you can't delete what you've written
and we don't take posts down from here unless they've broken one of our
community rules. This is because our members spend a lot of time
composing replies, and there is a much wider audience that gets a lot
out of reading what has been written. It's not fair to ask the community
for support, then ask to have it removed once you've read it so others
can't also benefit. Use discretion when posting here - think about the
level of detail you are sharing, and think also about who might know you
are posting here. Also, please keep it clean: this is an all ages forum
and explicit discussions about sexual problems are not permitted.
Threads and posts of this nature will be removed and your account placed
on a moderation hold. 2. What do you want to get out of posting here?
Relationship and family issues are stressful. Members sometimes post
here seeking advice about a relationship that has broken down, but find
themselves getting upset when they don't agree with the response they
get. This is a peer support forum, meaning we are not mental health
professionals. We are people of all ages and backgrounds, with a wide
range of life experiences. While we aim for our discussions to be
conducted respectfully, people here will respond with the truth as they
see it, from their own experiences and perspectives. We are not here to
take sides. Offence is almost never intentional, but it can be sometimes
taken. The advice you will see here is not intended to be a substitute
for professional counselling. 3. What other support do you have? Most
people posting on our forums (about any issue) use this space as a
supplement to other supports. This forum is not and cannot be a
substitute for offline supports, but it is often a good place to start
the ball rolling and find the courage for seeking help. If you are
relying solely on an internet forum to resolve your relationship or
family issues, you are likely to be disappointed. Check out the Healthy
Homes section of our Healthy Families website for further information
and resources.

                 Hi, we are 25 yrs married this week. Have had up and downs. Husband has
had depression and anxiety, and refuses treatment. Our divorce
discussions began 2 years ago when he was violent. He isn't violent now
but can get mean (mean comments) when he's down. We have some big things
going on with our kids, but he won't seek help or counselling. We
separated our accounts when we separated, and he now holds that against
me as I work, earn and save more, and pay most of the bills. He is
saying he can't plan with me in the picture and just wants his 'cut' to
live his life as he wants. He hasn't had a discussion with me to what
that looks like, other than saying he'll move away out bush. I
understand and accept if he doesn't want to be in the marriage, however
I'm concerned he is making a big decision based on the depression. I'm a
bit lost to what to do, other than go along with it, as sad as it might
be. One of the big challenges we are both dealing with is one of our
adult kids is now trans. Any ideas to help ?

                 I am not going to insult anyone with the word "boomer" because deep down
I know not everyone is like that at that age group, but I can't help
myself at the moment: My whole life my parents have put pressure on me
and stopped caring about my wants, they wanted me out of the house as
soon as possible because I was the youngest and they wanted to retire. I
had pressure on me to stay in the country I studied and find any way
possible because I was told I was not welcome home again. So I wasted
most of my years here trying to figure out a way to stay. Thankfully I
have a wonderful fiance whom I've been with now for 12 years. It may
have started there, but lately now I get more and more resentful: I
found out after my parents passed they had money, but they got it
through doing some horrible things to our company's employees and not
very legal stuff. I lost even more respect to them. Now, I wanted to get
past this, but we are having trouble with our landlord. Years ago our
kitchen flooded because the upper apartment people put stuff down their
drain, our systems were connected and so our kitchen flooded, destroying
the old wood flooring. The boards shrunk and gaps are inbetween. I have
tried and tried to talk to the real estate and they said they contact
the landlord but never get a reply. Finally I saved all the emails and
have enough evidence, but I am so angry at this point as everything else
is so cheaply made in this apartment and falling apart.We pay rent on
time, are quiet, pay bills, keep things nice and clean and have never
had a complaint from our apartment checkups, yet we do the right thing
and have to suffer for it.Not to mention we will never be able to afford
a house unless we move way out, thankfully my fiance can get a job there
but I would be fucked. Then my mother in law kept saying she is worried
for a war, spending so much money they have doing nothing...whereas us
we probably won't even see the point of making it to 60. At least we
aren't as selfish and having children so we make the next generation
suffer, but I have become selfish, I just want them to suffer that's how
bad my anger is! It is all too much and I have been trying so hard to do
the right thing all the time and can't seem to care about people close
to me who are in that age range because of all of this! I don't want to
be hateful but then I see them talk like this and I get angry again!

year ago and haven't seen my dad or siblings for years I havr no friends
I'm so lonley I want to find love but I'm thinking this will be
impossible. I also suffer anxiety which of course makes it harder. I
feel that i have nothing in life to look forward to besides my kids
which I love with all my heart but one day they will be grown and gone.
And not many men would want to take on 5 kids that are not theres. I
feel so sad lonley unloved and unwanted and I'm sure I'm destined to be
alone forever just venting

                 I need sadvice or even just to vent and make me feel not so alone.I am
not sure what or how to handle the situations I am currently facing with
my eldest especially, although all my kids are high needs with ADHD,
intellectual disability, suspected ASD, anger issues, behavioural
problems and more. Here's a very basic rundown. My 14 yr son has always
been a struggle and has had issues since toddler years with his
behaviour and need for control. (He witnessed his dad abuse me at 2.5yrs
and when his little bro was born he became extremely protective of us
both at age 3)He has gone through a lot of changes and witnessed
incidents in his life which i know would play a part in his overall
development. Most of his life I have been a single mum, I tried to date
but he would push any potential partner away from me (mentally and
physically) until they would leave for good.Covid and puberty
(2020/2021) escalated everything, he became threatening towards me,
controlling, manipulative and basically tried to rule the house and by
this stage I had 2 more kids (now aged 14,11, 7 and 4) it became living
on eggshells around him. He would rage and break things if he didn't get
his way. This still happens but not as intense and he does have slightly
more control over his actions and we have all had alot of family support
services involved, including police from things hes been involved in. He
steals money from us, lies all the time, treats his siblings and i like
crap (then can be super nice and they dont understand at all) I stopped
his pocket money but always has money (i now know its from drug drops
for a dealer) He left school early year 8, how the hell was I meant to
"force him to go"?He has so much freedom because how do i stop him, he
sleeps all day and goes out late afternoon.He has so many workers
involved to support him but he won't engage or tells them what they want
to hear. This is all a very brief post and happy to tell more as I'm
desperate for help and advice as these services are useless. The main
issue I have now is the drug use, it started a year ago with weed after
he told me he does it, (this is the thing he tells me EVERYTHING, it's
good but it's almost a control thing as he knows there's nothing I can
do so he tells me things i shouldnt really know as it puts me in a
difficult place) He has recently started taking acid and mushrooms and
I'm so worried about where he's heading, he calls himself a junkie and
that he wants to enjoy his life as it's going to be short anyway his
friends all do drugs and it's horrible. I know some of the parents whose
teens do it yet the parents think they're perfect and I once told a
parent and she blamed my son yet her son was the one who introduced my
KID to it all, so I can't tell any of these other parents as they will
blame me for not "controlling my child" I have never felt so alone and
holding so many secrets to the point I suffer physically and
mentally.All this while trying to maintain the other kids lives as
normal as possible and their behaviours have also escalated. I feel
hopeless and have so much regret and thoughts, like where did I go
wrong.I am now in a same sex relationship, who the kids all accepted
thankfully and my gf is a great help but my 14yo issues do affect us
both and it strains the relationship, so I also have those issues going
on. What am I meant to do? Police won't do anything, no one can force my
eldest to stop drug taking, no such thing as rehab they've told me. I'm
so worried about my other kids seeing and hearing all that happens, I
try to shield them but they still see it and know that's trauma to them
and explains some of their attitudes.They also have many of their own
issues and I know it's only going to get worse as they grow up.I'm
drained in every way possible, I imagine running away and disappearing
every single day, I can't eat, I can't sleep, I struggle even more with
all these services involved as I'm constantly needing to discuss the
Children which just creates more stress. I have never felt more alone
then I do now.

                 Hello all. to start this discussion, I would just like to say that I am
in the 15-18 age area, so take this to mind. This has all happened in
the last few months. I am not overweight for my age, but I am a littler
chubbier than the beauty standards would like me to be. I have become
extremely insecure to the point where I told my mother I had period
cramps to get out of going to school for three days. I got into a
massive fight with my "friend". I decided to tell her how I was feeling
one day, hoping she would help me and support me, but instead, she said
"You're not the only one with mental health issues, stop trying to act
special to get attention". I haven't talked too her since, and I've been
eating lunch in the school bathrooms. Ever since then, I've been finding
the smallest things people do extremely irritating, and a get angry so
easily. Is here something wrong with me? Please help!

so I'm reluctant to give info but also I guess that's the point. I think
what I'm looking for is likeminded people and support to get me through
until this lockdown allows for me to make the steps I need to make. I've
had a lot of adversity in my life. It's come to the point I can no
longer function and I have been bedridden for months. I'm a single mum
with no support, I've started to see my own parents are abusive and the
cause of so much pain so now that I see that I have no idea how I will
raise my child as I was hoping they would take on a role in assisting
me. My ex isn't around. So we live with them now as I can't even care
for myself and that's when I've relised the severity. I left my ex due
to domestic violence done years of work for us both to heal and earlier
this year everything started to unravel and feel like I'm right back
where I started so it feels I'll never get through it. I feel I've lost
my identity like what I had with my ex was an illusion, now I feel my
parents and my whole life is also an illusion. I'm scared for my child I
think she deserves a foster home or something I feel so inadequate I
don't know how to get better for her anymore. I question my worth as her
parent I have been through worse and keep strong to keep her safe, I
really wish she jus had loving capable parents, I have seriously
considered this option and spoke with docs about it but she's had
everyone give up on her, my parents actually kicked us out earlier this
yr we were homeless then things came to a head and I was advised to
return. I left her dad for her to have a better life but I feel
nothing's changed coz I'm so broken. What I was trying to escape is
actually our reality. So bcoz everyone's given up on her I can't I know
how lost she'd be without me and it would be so painful for us both, but
I also can't keep going this way. I have never felt normal I have never
had genuine loving support that wasn't a person with an ulterior motive
so trust is an issue. I don't trust or love myself I try. Honestly if I
could foresee this life for her I wouldn't have had her coz it hurts so
very much to hurt the 1 person you really love and she's the only person
who's ever loved me and I have no idea how to love. Sorry I'm getting
heavy it's jus not fair for her. I'm the adult to make the changes I
know what I should do but I feel like I'm locked in a prison jus
watching unable to do anything.

                 I've been facing my issues for 13 years. A lot of that time I was aware
of my issues but didn't do much to fix them. In the past few years, I've
made a lot of progress. I have a stable job with bosses and colleagues
who love and treat me well. I've gotten better at socialising - still
not fantastic and can get anxious, but not as much as before. The people
in my life have nothing but good things to say about me.The one thing
that I have not had in the past 13 years is love, dating, romance. I
haven't had it because for the most part, I haven't gone after it. It
could be a cop-out for my avoidance, but I want a happy and healthy
relationship and to be in one, you need to be happy and healthy
yourself. So I've been a work in progress for a long time.But I'm
starting to think that for a while now I would have been enough for a
nice woman, it's just me that I have not been enough for. I'm trying to
be perfect, but it will never be enough. I'll fix all my superficial
flaws - it won't be enough. I'll have friends tell me that I'm a great
guy, attractive, sweet, sexy - they must be lying or just trying to be
nice.I don't even know what I'm doing anymore because I don't even know
what it would be like to feel enough. How would you describe your
feeling of enough? The feeling that lets you put yourself out there and
gets people to love you in the way that I've been missing.

I get my son Thursday after school and stays with me right through the
weekend. We live an hour away from his school, so spending 2 hours in
the car for him on Friday is so exhausting for a young boy of 7 by the
time the weekend comes he doesn’t want to really go anywhere… I mean nor
do I. We already live busy lives. Though I am in deep trouble because I
don’t take my son out to see his granddad anymore… we used to visit each
other occasionally when we lived in town. I also do hours upon hours a
week of driving on top of work and maintaining the property where we
live, my father and I don’t really have a great relationship but I have
been threatened by another family member saying I am with holding my son
from my father… that’s not the case. We all so damn exhausted we don’t
want to be running around at the end of the week, we’re all spreading
ourselves so thin. I’m so tired of the drama and being made feel like I
have to run after him. I understand grandparent grandson relationships
are important but I just don’t know what to do. He can come out and see
him if he would like, though I like people to text before coming out as
a courtesy.

my previous relationship, he has none (though he treats them as his
own). James works in an industry where there are a lot of women and has
always had female friends. He made it clear at the beginning and wanted
to make sure I was ok with that. I said yes as I trusted him. James
become friends with Claire through work about 3 years and she also ended
up being a client of his in his line of work. At one stage I began to
feel uncomfortable with frequency of their texting and other little
things like gift she got him for his bday with I felt was too much. He
assured nothing was happening etc, but there was always something that
made me uncomfortable. One thing being he was always quite secretive
with his phone. I also tried to suggest we all go out and I become
friends with Claire too and he’d say yeah yeah but never do anything
about it. I tried not to look too much into it, and I wanted to trust
him. However other than this, I did not question our relationship. He
lived with me and kids and felt he loved me and always there for us.
Always does sweet little things like bring me a coffee every morning and
drop a lovely lunch to me at work. He is brilliant with the kids as
well.Anyway, tbh while Claire is still in James life, I do feel it has
backed off a lot in the past year. Recently however, James got so drunk
to the point of me having to look after him and put him to bed. His
phone was lying on the floor. I couldn’t resist and looked at his phone
and went through all their msgs. They had a very volatile
friendship/relationship, with lots of her yelling at him and calling him
vile names. This causes me to scroll back very far in time and my worst
fear was met, they were fooling around behind my back about a 1.5 years
ago. I am so heartbroken and devastated, and empty. I confronted James
about it the next day and he broke down. He admitted what happened a
while ago and he is so incredibly sorry and will do anything to make
things right. Which he did immediately by blocking her off all forms of
contact/social media. He then proceeded to tell me that after he made
his mistakes with her she turned on him and began to constantly use
threats to tell me and ruin our family. To the point of photoshopping
messages she sent to me , which she never actually sent. She would try
to call him 10 times and if he didn’t respond she threatened to tell me.
She also told him horrible physical things she would do to him like stab
him etc. It was all to terrorise and break him. Which i believe as I saw
a lot of it in those msgs. She is absolutely crazy.I found out 2 weeks
ago and I’m still devastated. He says he is so sorry ang will do
anything and everything to make things right. I am considering trying to
work this out. But my mental state is so all over the shop. I feel so
inadequate, sad, depressed, alone you name it. I keep thinking what did
she have that I don’t? I am more attractive than her so it’s not that …
from the msgs she is a cold hearted b$&amp;ch so it’s not her personality.
He tells me he doesn’t know why he did it, he loves me and always has,
and has never been unhappy in our relationship.I don’t even know what I
want /need from posting this, but maybe I just needed to write it out.

                 Hi everyone, The Relationships &amp; Family Issues section is one of the
busiest here on our forums. It's also one of the areas where we find
members can get themselves into trouble! Before posting here, take a
deep breath and be mindful of the following...

                 Hi everyone, The Relationships &amp; Family Issues section is one of the
busiest here on our forums. It's also one of the areas where we find
members can get themselves into trouble! Before posting here, take a
deep breath and be mindful of the following 3 tips: 1. Do you really
want to share this with the world? This is a public forum. Are you
thinking of posting something that could identify you to a friend or
family member? Once you've posted, you can't delete what you've written
and we don't take posts down from here unless they've broken one of our
community rules. This is because our members spend a lot of time
composing replies, and there is a much wider audience that gets a lot
out of reading what has been written. It's not fair to ask the community
for support, then ask to have it removed once you've read it so others
can't also benefit. Use discretion when posting here - think about the
level of detail you are sharing, and think also about who might know you
are posting here. Also, please keep it clean: this is an all ages forum
and explicit discussions about sexual problems are not permitted.
Threads and posts of this nature will be removed and your account placed
on a moderation hold. 2. What do you want to get out of posting here?
Relationship and family issues are stressful. Members sometimes post
here seeking advice about a relationship that has broken down, but find
themselves getting upset when they don't agree with the response they
get. This is a peer support forum, meaning we are not mental health
professionals. We are people of all ages and backgrounds, with a wide
range of life experiences. While we aim for our discussions to be
conducted respectfully, people here will respond with the truth as they
see it, from their own experiences and perspectives. We are not here to
take sides. Offence is almost never intentional, but it can be sometimes
taken. The advice you will see here is not intended to be a substitute
for professional counselling. 3. What other support do you have? Most
people posting on our forums (about any issue) use this space as a
supplement to other supports. This forum is not and cannot be a
substitute for offline supports, but it is often a good place to start
the ball rolling and find the courage for seeking help. If you are
relying solely on an internet forum to resolve your relationship or
family issues, you are likely to be disappointed. Check out the Healthy
Homes section of our Healthy Families website for further information
and resources.

                 Hi all I have been struggling to deal with a breakup of 5 months with a
guy who I was dating. We definitely have both been through trauma and
have already started a bit of a toxic back and forth. About a month ago
I offered friendship as a solution to our trust problems. For context we
live long distance but have discussed moving in with each other at some
point if everything went well. He was always very clear in saying he
struggled badly with relationships ending so he had to be certain this
was something he wanted. I found this off the bat really hard as it kind
of put the onus on me to "prove" to him that I was worth it. We seemed
to get along very well as friends maybe because we both had relaxed off
the idea of a relationship. The distance also helped as we weren't
scared of bumping into each other but we spoke everyday morning to
evening. This is when he confided he had become very depressed and felt
very lonely to the point he was pushing away and loosing friends. I felt
safe enough to offer to go see him one weekend and spend some platonic
time and keep him company as he lives alone and I was becoming concerned
he would get worse. Obviously we care about each other deeply (or so I
though). Everything was fine until the morning of me going to see him-
he called me on the way there and basically told me not to come because
he was having an anxiety attack. I felt VERY triggered by this as it was
something we were both looking forward too and felt like he may have
been making an excuse to not see me. After some back and forth he began
saying that he wanted a relationship where people don't fight and maybe
he needed to keep looking for someone like that. I said if thats what he
wanted he could go have it I wasn't going to stop him. He also said
things like, he wasn't convinced a relationship was right for him, that
he was happier alone, that he needed to be 100% sure etc. He also said
he didn't think he was running out of time to find love and kept asking
why I would even want him when I have so many other options and If i was
with him out of desperation and there was no one else. For context we
are both in our 40's never married and no children. I did end up going
to his place once he calmed down but he had a manic episode and
basically ended the relationship and I left silently and blocked him. I
have no idea how to help/ deal with this and how to support someone
struggling like that. I also have bad anxiety and feel guilty that i
left him like that

                 Hi everyone, I've posted on here a few times before, but I ended up
stopping because I felt I was in a better headspace. Telling by the fact
I'm posting once again, clearly something has changed. I'm 18, and I
moved back in with my mother and her boyfriend around the start of last
year. I had moved away from her previously because of how strained our
relationship had become. When I came back, it felt like she and I had
finally started to heal. We weren't arguing half as much, she was less
neglectful, and overall it just seemed like things had gotten better.
That was until a few months ago. Around August, my mother and her
boyfriend moved into a new house, and it was from here on out that
things started going downhill. It wasn't bad at first, but it's to the
point where I dread even coming from work. She's constantly furious with
me, even when there's nothing to be mad about. Not to mention, when I
get paid, she takes almost all my money. I understand that I'm 18 and
need to pay my way, but $130+ every time I get paid has been so
financially draining, especially when there are countless things I need
to save up for but can't because the more money I make the more she
wants. She doesn't have a job either, so sometimes it feels like she
uses the board as an excuse for me to give her more than she needs. I'm
at the worst point I've been in a long time, and it's to the point where
I'm planning on going to a local motel for a few days once I've got a
bit of money saved up (nothing suspicious, I just really need some time
away from her, and I have nowhere else to go.) I'm sorry for the long
rant, and if you're reading this, thank you for listening. If anyone has
any idea on how I can cope with this, please let me know!

morning, my partner asked me as soon as we got out of bed if he could
watch p*rn. He knows p*rn is something I don’t want in the relationship
/ am triggered and hurt by. We have been to therapy together to discuss
it too, and our therapist stated that it’s fine to watch it, as long as
we have spoken about it and are both okay with it. I’m not okay with it
anymore, due to past trauma and sexual abuse. At the start of our
relationship, it didn’t bother me, but after being betrayed countless
times by my partner, I’m now not okay with it. It hurts me too much.
Despite knowing all of this, and me expressing how I felt about it on
the weekend, my partner went ahead and pleased himself several times to
p*rn. Mind you, he was telling me the night before that we were going to
be intimate, but he never followed through. We haven’t had s*x for a few
days either, so him choosing p*rn over real intimacy with me really
opened the wound more. It even went as far as him sleeping in the spare
room and spending the whole weekend behind closed doors. No
communication, nothing. This left me in tears the whole weekend.
Especially when I had to sleep alone at night, knowing he was deceiving
me / going against what I said. Come Sunday night, he finally started to
‘try’ and hug me etc, but by that point I was so numb that I didn’t want
to show any affection, or even talk to him or be near him. I feel so
betrayed. I feel like my concerns and emotions were rejected and walked
all over. Also, what kind of partner actively chooses to pleasure
themselves to p*rn when they have a partner at home expressing they want
to be intimate ?! I never once turned it down or said I didn’t want to.
He has literally chosen other females over me, and it is killing me.

                 My partner and I have been together 5 years.On all accounts, we are a
perfect match, very much in love, same interests, the same sense of
humour and love each other's company.We both have one child from
previous relationships, 10 and 8. For the past two years we have all
been living together, and although we knew combining families can be
difficult, it feels like we’ve overcome most hurdles and do feel like a
family unit. Her son though, 10, is still very attached to his mother.
It has been difficult to develop a relationship with him, after two
years of living together he still cannot initiate a conversation with
me. I’m the type of person kids and animals usually flock to, all the
other children I know, my son, his friends, and nephews all gravitate
towards me, and I’ve never had difficulty conversing with any of them.
He is attached to his mother all day and all night, apart from school
hours.From early morning he is demanding her cuddles, if she gets too
close to me he will run over and jump on top of her, if she puts an arm
around me, he will physically pull it back over him, if she walks away
from him to see me he will follow and sometimes gets angry at her for
leaving his side. He demands to sit next to her everywhere we go, he
keeps one arm on her while we eat, and he demands that she sleep in the
same room as him and go to bed at the same time, which she does every
night. When my partner says no to him, he will go into a tantrum that
will last hours on end, screaming crying, and sometimes becoming
physical until she backs down. If my partner were to say no to sleeping
in his room, you can be assured there would be screaming, shouting and
kicking on doors until she gives in or the sun comes up.The only time we
get to share any intimate moment without him present or on top of her is
one night a week when he stays with his father. I feel like a third
wheel in my own relationship. I’ve tried to be supportive and open
towards him, attended all of his soccer games, and tried to initiate
conversations, but he will usually completely ignore me unless my
partner tells him to respond.At the end of the week, my partner is
usually gloomy, says she feels lonely and asks me why I’m the one being
aloof.I’ve tried talking to her about this, but she is dismissive and
defensive, I think she has an idea this is an issue, but certainly not
to the extent it is harming our relationship.I’m not too sure what to

                 I've been married for just over two years now and I am having issues
with my husbands sister. I've been with my partner 10 years in total and
when I first met his sister she was so nice to me, we'd spend so much
time together we were super close. Then one day when my now husband
proposed to me and we got engaged that all changed. His sister became
quite distant and she started treating me differently. She doesn't want
to communicate with me as much, bother to ask how I am doing, she always
seems disinterested in me, I feel like we are enemy's sometimes. At our
engagement party she never even spoke to me and left the party early -
didn't want to celebrate. The same happened at my hens party when she
arrived she didn't even speak to me at all and all she wanted to do was
go to my husbands bachelor party to see what he was up to. There are a
lot more examples than this just to name a few... When my husband lived
at home with his sister, his sister would constantly text him all the
time (even when he was on holiday with me), buy lunches/dinners for him,
organise his birthday, holidays for them, and I feel like since I got
married to her brother maybe his sister feels as if i'm taking her
brother away from her. This situation is making it so awkward and
upsetting for me. What really hurts the most is that I used to be so
close with his sister and now its like we were never friends. How can I
improve my relationship with sister?

                 Good morning everyone I have posted a few different discussions on this
forum over the years, but I am really stuck with a situation right now
that I have been trying to solve myself but with no clear outcome. I am
hoping that you will be able to help me. I met a new lady in my life two
years go. I am now 52 and couldn't believe that love came back into my
life after a 20 year marriage breakdown. We started dating, things moved
quickly and before we knew it, we were engaged to be married. It was all
a fairy tale but then cracks started appearing. My partner started being
quite negative. It only took a small problem to run into large ones. I
was being accused of saying or thinking things I simply wasn't. In 2023,
my partner decided she wanted to sell her family home and move in with
me. As it had only been 14 months, myself and her entire family
including her two kids told her not to do that. I suggested renting her
property out for 12 months so that she would benefit from income whilst
at the same time seeing if we could live together. That was ignored. She
sold the property anyway and then moved into my home. Once here, the
problems really started getting worse. My partner was suffering from
Menopause and the swings in mood were quite difficult to take at times.
I suggested she see someone for this which she did after a lot of
persuasion and she then went onto HRT which helped a little. I felt that
I couldn't do anything right. I would cook, clean, makes sure she had
everything she wanted but I was being told constantly that I wasn't
enough. I don't cope well with conflict, I am a people pleaser which I
know has negative conotations associated but I like to make sure the
people that surround me are respected and loved. My 18 year old son who
lives with me here 4 days a week has high social anxiety issues and I
was constantly told that he should get out more, meet new friends, that
I shouldn't be his support for fun and company. He is my world, that
really upset me and it was ongoing. My partner moved out three weeks
ago. I read messages on her phone (she gave me the phone to look at)
where she has really belittled me to her family. She wants to get back
together and when she is good, she is amazing. When she is bad, it's the
polar opposite. I need advice. Help me.Mark

more and more sensitive to the point I am insecure.Eg: he'd receive an
SMS 'I wish you were here swimming with me'Or receiving SMS from girls
at like 12am sharp wishing him a happy birthday.There was a moment we
went camping with his friend &amp; the wife,couple date. Got drunk to the

get they're all highschool friends but felt wrong. Especially being
drunk.. I confronted him the next day about it &amp; he apologized.Years go
by &amp; we all catch up again, this time, at theirs. Once again we get
drunk, I was about to sleep but when I noticed hubby wasn't sleeping
next to me, I walked out to find he was ontop of her, nothing physically
happened but it almost looked like things were getting there.There were
a few other things that had happened which I cannot find normal, however
I feel these actions have accrued &amp; is making me drown in
disappointment.I almost don't know myself anymore; I am unsure if I
still love my husband, who is also the father to our two boys.Recently,
we rented our spare bedroom to a young male who has now been living with
us for two weeks.I have to admit, him &amp; I would talk about things that
have a similar interest &amp; we got quite close. He's 9 years younger than
me &amp; had recently broken up with his girlfriend so our conversation was
almost counselling. Hubby sleeps early every night due to early work
commitments so there was a time where hubby and the kids went to bed &amp;
it was just the sharemate &amp; I.We had a few drinks &amp; talked for four
hours late at night. Hubby would walk in &amp; ask what we're doing..
confused with the situation.Few days later, again, us two would be left
talking late at night etc. Hubby wasn't happy, he cracked it at me
saying the boys keen. I enjoyed his company I won't lie but I couldn't
help but stick up for the guy. Should I keep my distance? I think the
boy knows why hubby &amp; I argued, he looks cautious.

                 Hi all, I have finally made the decision to leave my husband after being
together for 22 years and 4 kids. We have had issues for a long time
which he refuses to seek help for and he put me through hell last year
when I asked for a separation to see if we would be happier. A side of
him cameout that I have never seen before and the venom in his voice and
way he spoke to me was awful. He kept telling me to “get a f$&amp;!ing job”
and stop sponging off him (we had 4 kids in 5 years and I have attempted
to work and study many times and the family has fallen apart as he
hasn’t picked up the slack at all and I was even hospitalized for
getting so sick doing everything) he threatened to close our accounts
and leave me without money, threatened the kids against me, abused and
said violent things about me to his sister via text and then wouldn’t
let me leave the house for even a night to escape. I was in severe
depression and suicide watch at the time (I had told him this and showed
him all my psychologist notes) but he took no notice and eventually one
night I tried to end my own life as I felt so trapped (not blaming him
for that but it was just another straw) we saw a counsellor for a few
months be he slowly lost interest and the troublesome behaviour
continued. He is constantly angry, stressed and aggressive unless he
drinks. Tensions are rising again between us and I’m terrified he will
turn in to the monster he was last year again. We haven’t been able to
claim Centrelink for years because he never gives me the details they
need and hasn’t done a tax return for years so now we have a debt! I’ve
been looking for a job for years and I know I won’t get (or want)
anything from him but i need to leave and soon. Does anyone know of any
loans, assistance I can get from Centrelink or public housing etc (my
children identify as indigenous but I don’t) I’ve been trying to call
Centrelink for weeks and can’t get through! Any help would much
appreciated

work together so in front of our staff he will portray a loving husband
even if he’s belittled me that morning. He is not interested in how I
feel or am feeling and never has been, I must support him in all that he
does. I was too young to know what coercive control was or looked like
when we got together. But all I know now is that I felt wrong from the
get go and forced myself into a situation I thought was right. My family
do not like him and my closest ally, my sister, has now washed her hands
of me at what she thinks is my feeble attempts to leave. I announced
that I wished to seperate last week but he thinks I’m bluffing again. I
don’t know how to get out of this…. I need support but I can’t ask my
family at the moment, they’ve always been amazing but I think I may have
used up all my empathy credit with them., I am in such a deep depression
I really don’t want to be here anymore, I can’t bail out because I
wouldn’t do it to my daughter, not sure where to draw my strength from
now as all I want to do is sleep. Thought about calling 1800 respect to
find out whether relationship is really abusive because where I’m
sitting I’m not sure anymore. I’m almost 50 and I love being by myself
so I’m not afraid to be alone for the rest of my life, I’m just afraid
for my child who is 11 and loves her father but does fear him a little.
There has been no physical violence just emotional abuse…. I’d just love
to hear from anyone really who has had a similar experience. Thanks for
letting me speak

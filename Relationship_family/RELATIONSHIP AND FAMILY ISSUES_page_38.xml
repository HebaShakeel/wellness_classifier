                 Hi everyone, The Relationships &amp; Family Issues section is one of the

                 Hi everyone, The Relationships &amp; Family Issues section is one of the
busiest here on our forums. It's also one of the areas where we find
members can get themselves into trouble! Before posting here, take a
deep breath and be mindful of the following 3 tips: 1. Do you really
want to share this with the world? This is a public forum. Are you
thinking of posting something that could identify you to a friend or
family member? Once you've posted, you can't delete what you've written
and we don't take posts down from here unless they've broken one of our
community rules. This is because our members spend a lot of time
composing replies, and there is a much wider audience that gets a lot
out of reading what has been written. It's not fair to ask the community
for support, then ask to have it removed once you've read it so others
can't also benefit. Use discretion when posting here - think about the
level of detail you are sharing, and think also about who might know you
are posting here. Also, please keep it clean: this is an all ages forum
and explicit discussions about sexual problems are not permitted.
Threads and posts of this nature will be removed and your account placed
on a moderation hold. 2. What do you want to get out of posting here?
Relationship and family issues are stressful. Members sometimes post
here seeking advice about a relationship that has broken down, but find
themselves getting upset when they don't agree with the response they
get. This is a peer support forum, meaning we are not mental health
professionals. We are people of all ages and backgrounds, with a wide
range of life experiences. While we aim for our discussions to be
conducted respectfully, people here will respond with the truth as they
see it, from their own experiences and perspectives. We are not here to
take sides. Offence is almost never intentional, but it can be sometimes
taken. The advice you will see here is not intended to be a substitute
for professional counselling. 3. What other support do you have? Most
people posting on our forums (about any issue) use this space as a
supplement to other supports. This forum is not and cannot be a
substitute for offline supports, but it is often a good place to start
the ball rolling and find the courage for seeking help. If you are
relying solely on an internet forum to resolve your relationship or
family issues, you are likely to be disappointed. Check out the Healthy
Homes section of our Healthy Families website for further information
and resources.

                 im mannat and still living with my parents. long story short, my parents
are extremely abusive and controlling. they try to meddle with several
of my life decisions which can be as simple as going out with my friends
to something like uni choices and what major i should go for. when i
dont give in, they guilt trip me and make me feel like its my fault
which disturbs me mentally a lot. ive been having multiple
issues(health, studies etc.) because of this. its as if i gotta make
sure they are okay so that nothing happens to me. like at times, when i
do take a stand for myself, it results in them not giving me food or
letting me go out of my room for a long time. they often tell me how i'm
a failure and how i can't do anything in the outside world. they don't
allow me to go out with my friends AT ALL or even alone to some cafe.
they have allowed me no independence at all even in simple choices as to
what flavor of cake id want or smth like that. they also often tell me
how i owe them and if i try to not care about them and literally ignore
them, it results in them crying or being sad and giving me 'life
lessons' saying how they are doing this for me. it's been so confusing
because i literally have no idea what to do or if im the one in the
wrong. it makes me overthink a lot nowadays, especially for around a
week or so. i cant even sleep properly at night because of this. i am
planning to move away soon and get into a uni of my choice, but as of
now i just need advice on how to detach myself from my parents, how to
live with them(considering how they keep threatening to take away my
internet, phone, laptop, food, water, literally anything i need), how to
manage myself mentally, how to still be able to earn money and have a
living, and how to stand up to them.

Waiting lists for help are ridiculous. 12 months wait for a
paediatrician. Appointment is booked for late July 2024 (been waiting
since early 2023).... We can't wait any longer. Our family is falling
apart. I can't cope with his behaviour NOW. I need help NOW. Not in
another 6 months after already waiting a year. Many professionals don't
seem interested &amp; just blame it on my parenting. School thinks he needs
to be assessed too though, so clearly I'm not just a bad parent....🤦‍
Costs are ridiculous &amp; I'm running out of money. My older child also has
ADHD, but it took 8 years to get him diagnosed as the waiting lists were
ridiculous &amp; many of the professionals didn't care. I'm struggling with
parenting him too. We can't afford therapy for both kids at the same
time unfortunately, so one doesn't get help. Thanks to the disgusting
costs.... Neither child is eligible for NDIS..... Honestly I'm about to
have a breakdown. I can't cope anymore.

                 I have been with my husband for 22 years. We now have a 7 year old boy
and an 8 year old girl. 4 months ago I asked my husband to move to the
spare bedroom. He has however continually tries to get back to the main
bedroom which I have said no to until he is sober. Everyday is
different. One day he promises to get sober after a certain date
(normally after say an event is on, friends leaving town, birthday etc).
Never happens. I recently told the kids that their Dad is an alcoholic
and a sick man and I don't love him anymore. I told them that as long as
he stays in the spare bedroom we will stay a family unit. My son doesn't
understand why I don't love his Dad and is worried his Dad will leave us
because he knows I don't like him and my husband has been verbal about
his requirements in the house. He still holds down a VERY good job
however I am fearful he will lose it. He will get caught drink driving a
company car or something will happen. He is verbally abusive when
confronted. Purchased a vibrator for me and when I refused to use it or
have sex with him (been months) he told me he was going to use it on
another woman who will like it, threatened to cut me off from the bank
account, told me he has "needs", among an array of other things. Passed
out in the bathtub a few weeks ago and flooded the house. I had to wake
him and make him clean up all the water. It was down the hallway and
into the dining room. The list is extensive and I hide as much as I can
from the kids. All my husbands friends think I am too hard on him. Half
of them are alcoholics as well. The situation is intense. I have been in
hospital twice with anxiety. My husband now tells my I am telling the
kids he is a 'bad person". He is in complete denial. Any tips especially
regards the kids?

be intimate with him for a long time. He is a heavy drinker, drinks
daily but is not aggressive or abusive, but it impacts on me as it means
he can’t take the kids to sport, get dinner and he just sits on couch
playing Xbox I have told him for years about my concerns with drinking,
how much time he spends on Xbox etc. I do all the activities with kids,
he doesn’t come as he sees it as time for himself to play Xbox. The kids
have noticed it and So do my friends. I do nearly everything around the
house &amp; work FT. I have to ask him to help &amp; when I finally flip out
about things that have been building for months he acts as if I'm
nagging him. I do a lot of things that I know a lot of my friends don’t
do. I fill his car with oil bc he doesn’t &amp; then it dies on me when I
drive it, I take garbage to the tip, I pick up the dog poop &amp; clean the
bird cage, these are just small examples but it sets the tone. I was
recently diagnosed with cancer (I’m 40) &amp; went through chemo &amp;
radiation. Tbh I was very surprised at how helpful he was during chemo.
But as soon as it finished, he also stopped helping out. I am still not
in remission. I still do all of those things I mentioned, incl back to
work FT &amp; raising kids. He hasn’t done anything around the house for a
long time. We got home from vacation on NYE &amp; I asked nicely if he could
find this week to get containers from attic so I can put Xmas decos
away. He said he would, it’s been a week. I asked again today. This time
he was being such a smart arse asking why I couldn’t get in the roof &amp;
get them. I’ve been working all week, he’s been on annual leave (he has
5 weeks leave over the Xmas period) and not taken kids out once. He
knows my body aches from chemo still and he still expects me to climb
into the roof &amp; get down boxes. I don’t think it was a lot for me to
ask. I told him a few days ago that I need him to stop drinking as I
found out that a little while ago he &amp; a mate &amp; our kids went out &amp; on
the way home his other friend wanted a lift home, so my hub asked his
friend (who was driving) to put my 10yo boy in the boot of the car so
his other friend could get a lift. I am still fuming. Today I lost it
after he told me to get boxes from roof, and I’ve told him I’m done with
the marriage. This has been building for many years. I’ve been scared
because of financial reasons but I just can’t do it anymore. He is so
selfish, insensitive &amp; I’ve never felt like me and the kids are his
priority. He’s never made me feel like he’ll protect me. I know it’s the
right decision but I’m scared.

                 My husband and I have been married for 17 years . We love each other a
lot . I have known him to have OCD and wanting things to be in order and
put it down to house pride. It's over the last few years ever since we
have our own home this has become unbearable . We have a 9 year old and
he is paranoid about his walls, car and we rarely allowed to have guest
over. He spends hours washing the dishes . If anyone comes by he will
wash , vaccum and even cleans the walls. We aren't allowed to drive the
car to the beach, we will check the car for any scratches when I drive
it. It's so unbearable that even my daughter is freaking out about how
crazy he gets if things touch the wall or aren't a certain way. He has
become worse over the years. I love entertaining and have a big family
who always have us over and there are so many invites I haven't been
able to reciprocate to. I have said he needs help but he keeps saying he
is getting better. We moved from sydney to port to work on these issues
he has also to get away from so much distraction and family we had so he
can work on himself and actually live close to the beach so he can get
used to the sand . This is not something that has happened . We have
been here 6 months but I don't see change . It's really hard to live in
this controlling space. Help

                 Hi , I’ve had a mental illness for over 10 years due to a sexual assault
after a home invasion which left me with PTSD , panic Disorder, general
anxiety, agoraphobia, and since talking with my psychiatrist I found out
that I’m also suffering from BPD which apparently was a result from
sexually abused as a child but didn’t show any sign until the sexual
assault as a adult. Anyway after the home invasion My relationship
between my husband and myself just deteriorated because I just didn’t
want to be touched at all not even for a hug. So my husband and I just
separated but he stayed living with me and became my caregiver, because
I just couldn’t look after myself anymore and at one point my mental
illness got so bad that I was sleeping 20 hours a day and not eating and
no matter what I went through still stayed to take care of me. During
all of what was going on with my illness , my love for my husband never
went away and I still felt like he was my soulmate even though we were
separated. Over the last year I have learnt to control my illness a
little better to the point where I can now eat and live a semi normal
lifestyle ( I still have panic attacks and still can’t leave the house
alot and still suffer from BPD but I’m getting out of bed and started to
be happy. So the better I got I’ve noticed that the need for human touch
is coming back and I’ve started to feel like I want to be with my
husband again and want his affection.. so I spoke about this with my
husband and he told me that he has always loved me as much as he did
when we got married but knew that he had to put his feelings aside to be
my caregiver and also to respect me and what I was going through. After
our discussion we tried to be a husband and wife again and tried to be
affectionate and started weekly dates like cooking a meal together and
watching a movie but as soon as we got closer I started getting mad and
pushing him away and started to closing up again and put my personal
wall up , which upset myself and my husband and I also noticed that my
mental illness started declining again and I’ve noticed I’ve become very
depressed so I’m left wondering will I ever be able to have a
relationship with my husband or will my mental illness always stop that
from happening .

                 Hi all,I've been with my wife for 7 and a half years and married about 4
and a half years.In 2018 I moved away from her for 12 months to her home
town because she was home sick. We got married in her home town in 2019
and she eventually was able to relocate to her home town In the same
year. Whilst away from her I became very lonely and became addicted to
pornography. This eventually led to online infidelity to meet my needs
which I also became addicted too. Whilst it happened less and less it
still happened into our marriage until she found evidence of it in early
2020 and was extremely hurt. I don't believe she has ever truly
recovered. I sought counselling and got myself on the straight and
narrow and our marriage appeared back on track. In early 2023 I fell
back into the same behaviour. On the day I turned to infidelity she
found evidence again. I seeked help again and can honestly say I haven't
slipped back into that behaviour and I'm confident I won't repeat it or
would communicate it to my wife if I did struggle again with it.
Unfortunately in late 2023 my wife cheated on and I'm grateful she
admitted it. She said she never really forgave me the 2nd time around
and had been miserable ever sense. She has used my past behaviour as an
excuse to account for her own and hasn't shown any remorse. She wanted a
break initially which led to a seperation which was her call also. I
have forgiven her, we all make mistakes and I felt it would be
hypocritical of me not to give her a chance.Despite all that's happened
I never stopped loving her and I still love her in the seperation. If
she wants to rekindle the marriage It is what I want more than anything.
I just hope it's not beyond all repair which I believe it could be. I'm
giving her space and time to heal and find herself again. Based on what
I've said do you think there is any chance our marriage can continue? I
can't imagine my life without her, she means everything to me and I have

                 I made the choice to leave my wife, kids and the family home because our
situation and family environment was toxic for all of us and we were all
victims and perpetrators of DV. Both the wife and I have ongoing mental
health issues as well as myself battling a gambling addiction. I have
had zero contact with my kids for 3 months now and can’t see that
changing anytime soon. I feel the mother is very controlling in allowing
me access to our kids and I have no faith in the family court system. I
have no friends in life besides my work colleagues who don’t know the
extremities of my situation. I feel lost and have no direction in my
life. I miss my kids dearly and feel empty and very lonely without them.
I don’t look forward to the weekends as I’m just sitting around by
myself all weekend. I’m too nervous to try and meet new people and I
have no idea about how to make friends as an adult. I really struggle to
see how I can be happy again in the future. Any help or suggestions?
There’s so much more I can go into but I think this is a good overall
general start.

                 A week ago my partner dumped me out of the blue. We both have children
and were not living together, we all got along really well. He recently
finalised his separation with his ex wife and has been very stressed for
months and hasn’t been coping very well. I tried to support him through
everything I possibly could. We caught up for the first time a few days
ago and he looked so sad with tears in his eyes. He kept staring at me
but didn’t say much. He said he really wanted to try to stay friends and
I said I didn’t think it would work. He said he really needed to sort
his head out as he was so overwhelmed. He kept telling me about issues
he was having with his ex (mother to his children) and his conversation
was all over the shop and didn’t really make sense. Since that day, we
haven’t really spoken to eachother and he has been a bit brief when I
did reach out. we are catching up with all the kids in a few days to
spend a day doing a few activities we had already planned and I’m
freaking out about it. I don’t know if I’m ready to socialise like a
family again and not sure why he would want us to all meet up. I’m so
confused. I love him so much and have been trying to give him his space.
Is this a lost cause? Do I just cut him off and forget about him? He
hasn’t made any indication he wants to reconcile, just said, let’s catch
up with the kids and see how it goes. Help.

                 My wife and I have been together for over five years and have two
beautiful children. When we are alone we get along great, date often,
explore, laugh. Children changed us in that both their births were
traumatic and we are both still processing aspects of it. We didn't get
the happy early moments to help us deal with the tough slog of
parenting. Then sprinkle lack of support with covid on top. We are both
ambitious so we were in addition renovating a house at the same time
which forced me to work very long hours. With overwork and dealing with
my own emotional processing of trauma I didn't realise my wife wasn't
processing her trauma properly and she feels betrayed by me. It was all
too much and we pushed ourselves too far.We did couples counselling
where she mentioned she had thoughts of leaving, so I took drastic
measures to support her. We began talking and sharing. Improvements were
obvious. She finally took up activities outside of being a mum enrolling
in a new course. I could see her re-emerging from post natal. But
because of this improvement I stopped asking how she was as much as I
thought we had gotten to the point where she would be able to share. We
were still intimate until about a month ago, where I now discovered she
was approaching a year deadline of deciding whether the marriage will
work unbeknownst to me. Started avoiding me. Then dropped a bombshell
that she had had enough.I'm still in shock. Love her very deeply and she
loves me, just the romantic love falls in and out. I think part of that
is she senses chemistry with her new group of friends and in comparison
I seem boring. But I do most of the cleaning, night time kid shifts,
equal cooking, equal time looking after the kids and provide all the
income. She has no issues with any practical things. I have lots of
hobbies, just limited time. Because of this I've not had time for my
friends so my wife has the burden of being my sole adult emotional
outlet until I break out of the baby raising phase.I'm gearing up for a
further fight, but I'm not sure if I'm kidding myself and being
manipulated. She has said that her outlook on the institution has
changed and is not sure she believes in marriage. She wants to explore
connections with other people and believes that's a fuller life
experience. That maybe we are only meant to be with certain people for
phases of life and not have life partners. Which hurts me deeply because
I feel like I've been laying most of the foundation precisely to have
that more enjoyable part of life in the coming years only to find out
that maybe I was only useful for the hard work part. I think of her as a
soul mate and fully believe life partners are real and are a fuller
experience of life that is rare as gold. I just want the chance to have
the fun part of life with my soul mate.I'm already seeking out as many
therapists as I can, exercising, eating sleeping and talking to
friends/family so please no posts with that generic advice. I want to
know how do I know if I'm being delusional looking for hope? When I
think about it all it looks logically like she's moved on, but that
doesn't seem right given how connected it felt a month ago. I'm assured
there isn't another person specifically and at the moment she is after
space to see if she has the energy to fight for something between us.
I'm still a roller-coaster of emotion and my brain can't even start to
fathom an actual seperation. Therapist sessions will mainly be used to
try to prepare to avert a mental breakdown in case that is the reality
ahead of me. Thanks for the time for reading. Always full of love

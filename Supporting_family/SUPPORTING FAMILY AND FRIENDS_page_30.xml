                 This list has been compiled from experiences supporting my husband with
depression. There is no one size fits all, so please take what you are
comfortable with based on your circumstances and resources. 1. Reach out
to family and/or friends to feel supported - this also covers support
groups - online or face to face. Don't let stigma stop you from reaching
out. 2. Relationship boundaries - identify what is acceptable and not.
My general platform is that physical abuse is unacceptable as well as
regular demeaning/berating comments. Communicate this openly so everyone
understands. 3. Coping tools - this could be exercise, meditation,
reading a book, meeting friends, etc. They are important for your mental
health. 4. Knowledge is power - research to understand about depression.
The more you know, the better care you can provide. 5. Remember your
partner in the good times - this is their true selves, not the darkness.
6. Listen and show receptivity - without judgement or anger. If
communicate becomes strained, the timeout can provide clarity. Encourage
communication gently and try not to push. 7. Seek counselling - sharing
your feelings can provide an opportunity to off load the heavy stuff and
identify resilience and coping strategies. 8. Work as a team - don't let
mental illness be in the driver's seat. Offer to go to the Dr's and
support them. Understand medication and side effects. Be understanding
that some days are harder than others. 9. Words are powerful - remember
what you say cannot be taken back. 10. Carer Self-esteem and self-worth
- if you compromise these for the sake of supporting your partner, you
are likely to live with resentment towards your partner and the
circumstances you find yourself in. 11. Don't forget the children -
challenging circumstances at home can affect them mentally and
emotionally. Speak about mental illness (COPMI.com.au - has some great
resources) and be a strong foundation toward maintaining normality in
their daily activities. 12. Intimacy - there are many variables here, so
from my experience - keep communication open and make couple time to
connect. When my husband was depressed, daily hugs or holding hands
wherever possible worked for us. Some carers I have spoken with said
their partner would demand intimacy. My personal position is that
intimacy is about love without demands or attachments relating to
expectation. Demands only deplete the goodness in the connection and
sharing a a loving experience. [Moderator's note: this thread is for

                 We have been together for 4 years and are moving to living together more
permanently next year. Her last partner of well over 20 years was
unfaithful so there has been some insecurity issues around other women.
I haven't dealt with these issues in previous relationships so I have
just tried to be patient and supportive of her during these times. We
work together. These issues have been become more frequent this year as
my partner has become obsessively focussed on a work colleague. She is
sure that we are having secret meetings and that worries that something
big is looming. She is now hearing voices in the room next to her
believing that it is proof of this secret relationship. It doesnt matter
how much proof that I give her (the female colleague being absent from
work that day for instance) she will not believe. Many more (now daily)
examples of her fantasies that we are meeting secretly. My workspace is
highly regulated with camera and 'sign in' and so proof of where i am is
easy to come by. She turns into a different person when she has these
episodes . I have been able to talk her down to calm until recently but
they have become more frequent (daily now). I believe that the latest
these episodes started 4 months ago when she was under significant
family pressure (although they did exist before but far less
frequently). I have encouraged her to do some counselling around trust
issues (would like to do couples counselling but she finds this too
confronting) but since now she is hearing voices I am worried that she
needs greater assistance. Her personality challenges radically when she
has an episode, becoming very abusive and irrational. I feel that our
relationship is in crisis and would like to do everything that I can
save it as she is perfect in every other way. I am very happy to do this
journey back to healthy with her but she first needs to recognise that
there is something very wrong and secondly needs to seek help. I would
really appreciate any ideas, reflections or assistance. A good friend of
mine (psych) has told me that i should end the relationship now because
there are too many worrying signs. She has described the relationship as
abusive and manipulative. I understand her advice but am deeply in love
with my partner and would like to give her (and us) every chance.

                 Hello, First time posting. My 15 year old daughter has been suffering
from depression for almost a year now. I am not sure what event caused
it or if it is a combination but her first real boyfriend broke up with
her last year. Her best friend moved overseas and her friendship circle
broke down. I believe the fact that one of her friends in particular
started communicating with me about my daughters struggles may have
caused friction in the group and my daughter now feels guilt over that
also. She has been self harming, eating less and less each day and
withdrawn from her friends and everything that she used to love. I've
tried 2 counsellors but she doesn't want to talk to them. She opens up a
little to the guidance officer at school which is good but besides that
doesn't talk to anyone about her struggles. She has body image issues
and has lost a lot of weight, also refusing to eat in front of people.
We've been to a Dr today and had blood tests done after she disclosed
feeling often dizzy and light headed to the GO. I'd love to hear from
others who have been through this. Its so shattering to watch her go
through this. Previously I'd become all emotional and jump into 'fix it'
mode but I am now learning to keep calm and offer support rather than
advise. Thanks

                 Hi, I have been with my boyfriend for almost 3 years now, &amp; the whole
time I've known him he has had very low moods &amp; major self-esteem
issues. He finally decided after a low where he had dark thoughts that
he should seek professional help (after 2 years of me suggesting it), &amp;
after a month he was diagnosed with dysmythia/persistent depressive
disorder, which is suspected to have started around early high school
(he's now late 20's). Since his diagnosis, he's been more low than
usual, &amp; keeps referring to himself as broken. I've done a little bit of
research on it (not heaps, as he was only diagnosed recently) but I was
wondering if there is anything I can do to support him? He's really good
at letting me know when he's feeling down, &amp; I just feel kind of useless
because I don't know what I can do to help. Any attempts at asking if
there's something I can do always gets the "I don't know" answer. It's
also so hard to hear him talk about how much of a failure he thinks he
is, how he's a bad friend/son/partner, how much he hates the way he
looks (he's not overweight in the slightest but considers himself
disgusting). He asks how I could love him when he's "such a failure of a
person" or tells me he understands if I don't want to be with him, &amp; it
breaks my heart. We haven't been intimate in about 6 months because of
his body issues, which I have found rather difficult. He tells me he
straight up doesn't believe me when I compliment him, he won't talk to
his friends about anything (though sometimes he'll mention he's having a
bad day). He sees a psychologist every 1-2 weeks, &amp; is always very down
after every appointment. (Not sure if it's just hitting some
uncomfortable truths maybe?) It makes him hard to be around sometimes
when he's in a bad/low mood (even the dogs avoid him), &amp; it's a relief
sometimes when he wants to be left alone on his computer, though that
makes me feel guilty &amp; like a bad girlfriend for feeling like that. I'm
just not sure what I should be doing (or IF there's something) to help?
He knows I'm here to talk or even just listen, but he won't tell me
anything other than "I'm having a low day". I want to talk to his
friends about it because they're fantastic and supportive (they know
he's been struggling) but I'm worried that he'll see it as a breach of
privacy and trust. Trying to stay positive for the both of us is
exhausting some days (especially in lockdown), &amp; I'm just not sure what
or where to go from here?

                 Hi i recently walked out on my bi polar fiancé as it got abusive and
nasty. I wish I had read Tony's post about the cuppa before doing so,
I'm not a confrontational person at all, the is sure I cheated on her
which I didn't as she contacted the person and was told the same thing,
but still didn't believe either us. She told me she loved me and things
would change every time I went back but never did. The last time I went
back she hit me again so I walked. It's been nearly three weeks now I
haven't heard from her. Her family hate me as they all think I cheated
on her, she has told them I am a compulsive liar. I love and miss her so
much. have I made the right decision by leaving, not that I think I will
ever see or hear from her again. She is all I have thought about since I
left.

                 I’ve been with my boyfriend for 1 year now. He is amazing to me and we
are both generally very happy in love. When I first met him I knew he
would often use marijuana and I was fine with it. It wasn’t until later
in the relationship that I learnt he has an addiction and he openly told
me as well. We have spoken about it often and I do my best to support
him when I know he struggles. He will smoke marijuana every day after
work and every weekend when he has it, and it’s usually 24/7 that there
is marijuana in the house as he lives with a roommate who also smokes
it, so 97% of the time he is high. It’s not that the marijuana comes
between us or our relationship, that’s not the case and he is still able
to do things with me and go out with me without using it. Tonight we had
a talk about how he is feeling like he needs to work on himself and his
addiction. He has said to me that he uses marijuana because the drug is
better than life and it gives him a feeling that is better than any
other whilst it lasts and has thoughts of spending all of his money on
drugs but knows the consequences that would come along with this, yet
still has the urge to do it. I am finding it really hard right now as I
have a lot of fears for our relationship and the future of it. I wish I
could make him feel as happy as drugs can. I expressed to him my fear
that he might choose drugs over me eventually. He ended up saying that
he would be lying if he said to me he 100% wouldn’t choose drugs over me
because he doesn’t know. This made me feel really upset because I
obviously don’t want him to choose drugs over me and I don’t want to get
to the future and become heart broken because he chooses them over me. I
don’t want to leave the relationship because I love him so much and I
know he does love me. He has said that there isn’t anything I can really
do to help apart from supporting him which I already do. He has
acknowledged that he has a problem and is trying to work on it. I just
don’t know if there is anything else I can do to help him? I’ve never
dealt with this situation before and I’m really overwhelmed.

                 After struggling with treatment resistant depression for the past 4
years, my 23yo daughter ended up on life support in ICU 2 weeks ago
after (her first) suicide attempt. This is an event I'd predicted and
I've lived in constant dread, worrying ... not about "if" but about
"when". However, as I always try to look for the good things in all
situations, I'm grateful that the story thus far is different to what
I'd predicted. After 4 days in ICU, "medically" she is ok, there is
another chance to help her. The problem is she has tried all treatments
from ECT to TMS and many different cocktails of "the best" medications.
She diligently attends psychology groups/courses designed to help her
destructive thoughts, she is a good patient, a sensible patient, an easy
patient and she tries so hard to help herself. But for her, this makes
the situation more hopeless. Everytime she tries something new that
doesn't alleviate her pain the situation becomes even more hopeless and
she is tired and running out of energy to keep fighting. Right now I
feel she needs some extra support with mixed emotions from a failed
suicide attempt, she is not only experiencing her usual mental health
issues but she has added trauma and grief which are really affecting
her. I'm running out of ideas to find help and I feel desperate that
there may not be a next chance. I foolishly imagined that she would have
received counseling about what she was thinking/feeling at the time she
tried to take her life and there would be some sort of trauma counseling
so she could talk things through. She desperately wants to talk to
someone objective/impartial. She is really hurting. Help is so hard to
find, she can't even get an appointment with her psychologist for a
month. She sees her psychiatrist in hospital but he doesn't really talk
to her, just tells her he has tried everything and it's up to her, then
he tweaks her meds a bit more. I will do absolutely anything to get her
the help she needs and I will do absolutely anything to help her myself
but I feel like I just don't know where to turn. Any ideas would be
really appreciated. Thank you.

                 My spouse of 5 years suffers with depression. He is currently trying to
manage it on his own. A fortnight ago it became so unbearable he was
wanting to end his life. He decided he needed space, and wanted to
distance himself from his family and myself, in order to sort through
his emotions. He didn't speak to me for a week. As he is a regular FIFO
worker, it was an opportunity for him to get the space he needed.
Communication with me has been lacking, but I have heard from friends
that he is answering phone calls. He is battling with his self worth,
self esteem and currently questioning our marriage. He feels like he
can't love others if he doesn't love himself. He has been suffering with
depression for a while, however this is very unusual behaviour toward
our relationship. He has been withdrawn from regular hobbies. There have
been no sudden changes, that I can think of which may have contributed,
but I can't know for certain. I know we both make each other very happy.
We are always laughing and affectionate toward one another. As we've
both been in toxic partnerships before, we are very conscious of how we
treat each other, often talking about our emotions. I understand the
feelings related to self worth are impacting what he thinks he does or
doesn't deserve. I think pushing me away seems like the only thing in
his control right now. I have been doing everything I can to show my
support. I have encouraged him to seek help from services provided by
mine sites. Giving him space, alerting his family, letting him know I am
here, offering to collect scripts and making an appointment for him to
visit a councillor if he wishes to. I have stressed there is no
obligation to attend, but the offer is there if he wants to go down that
path. I am very worried for his safety. He is still refusing to
communicate with me beyond a text message every few days. He is due to
return home after his regular 2 week swing, only having 1 week of R&amp;R.
However I am afraid he will continue to isolate, demanding more space
and time, perhaps not even living with me when he returns home.
Ultimately, trying to push me away until I finally leave. I have made it
clear, I am sticking by him during his journey. He seems to ignore this
part. Is there any advice on how I can make him feel more supported? How
can I show my husband that pushing people away right now may not be the
right answer? How long should I wait before reaching out in person if he
continues to want space?

                 Hi Everyone, I am in need of some advice and help please. My husband and
I have been married for 5 years. My husband has depression (diagnosed
prior to us meeting) and it seems to be particularly bad at the moment.
Whenever I try to talk to my him about anything that I'm not
particularly happy with I get the response -he hates himself he never
does anything right and he may as well go die. I generally try to avoid
bringing up any subjects as I tend to be left feeling unheard and I then
need to make sure he is ok. Of late I have noticed more and more that he
is unable to hold a conversation with me, I can be in the middle of
talking and he will cut me off and start talking about something
completely different. It feels like he has so much on his mind that he
doesn't concentrate on anything anyone is saying. He seems to also have
a lack of motivation, sex drive, is very negative and just spends
anytime he can getting lost in his phone. (This is how he winds down )
His anger (not physical) and patience have also long gone. We have
talked many of times and he has promised to see someone but never
follows through on it. Or I will get reason why it is bad and he knows
what to do (exercise and eat better) but then never does. I'm starting
to feel a lil stretched, constantly am trying to make sure everything is
perfect so he has nothing to worry about when he gets home but there is
always something that he finds and that is what he will focus on and
won't even realize that he has got to come home and just relax. We both
work full time. Im Just not sure what I can do anymore to help. Any
advice or perspective would be appreciated.

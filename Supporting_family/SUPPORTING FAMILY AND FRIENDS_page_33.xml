                 This list has been compiled from experiences supporting my husband with
depression. There is no one size fits all, so please take what you are
comfortable with based on your circumstances and resources. 1. Reach out
to family and/or friends to feel supported - this also covers support
groups - online or face to face. Don't let stigma stop you from reaching
out. 2. Relationship boundaries - identify what is acceptable and not.
My general platform is that physical abuse is unacceptable as well as
regular demeaning/berating comments. Communicate this openly so everyone
understands. 3. Coping tools - this could be exercise, meditation,
reading a book, meeting friends, etc. They are important for your mental
health. 4. Knowledge is power - research to understand about depression.
The more you know, the better care you can provide. 5. Remember your
partner in the good times - this is their true selves, not the darkness.
6. Listen and show receptivity - without judgement or anger. If
communicate becomes strained, the timeout can provide clarity. Encourage
communication gently and try not to push. 7. Seek counselling - sharing
your feelings can provide an opportunity to off load the heavy stuff and
identify resilience and coping strategies. 8. Work as a team - don't let
mental illness be in the driver's seat. Offer to go to the Dr's and
support them. Understand medication and side effects. Be understanding
that some days are harder than others. 9. Words are powerful - remember
what you say cannot be taken back. 10. Carer Self-esteem and self-worth
- if you compromise these for the sake of supporting your partner, you
are likely to live with resentment towards your partner and the
circumstances you find yourself in. 11. Don't forget the children -
challenging circumstances at home can affect them mentally and
emotionally. Speak about mental illness (COPMI.com.au - has some great
resources) and be a strong foundation toward maintaining normality in
their daily activities. 12. Intimacy - there are many variables here, so
from my experience - keep communication open and make couple time to
connect. When my husband was depressed, daily hugs or holding hands
wherever possible worked for us. Some carers I have spoken with said
their partner would demand intimacy. My personal position is that
intimacy is about love without demands or attachments relating to
expectation. Demands only deplete the goodness in the connection and
sharing a a loving experience. [Moderator's note: this thread is for

                 Hi all, About 3 years ago I found some messages on my husbands phone and
it unravelled that he had a porn addiction which had moved to IMing
random people. I was devestated and we worked with a counsellor to move
through it and he went to see someone regularly to keep on top of his
addiction. Today I found new messages while using his laptop and
confronted him. He told me he relapsed 6months ago and was too ashamed
to tell me. I'm not sure what to do now. He's called his therapist and
rang our counsellor to make a time with her, but last time I said I
couldn't do this again. Was I being unreasonable thinking he wouldn't
relapse?

                 Hello i have been supporting (trying) my wife through depression and
anxiety for over 6 years now. To be honest I think I have been a very
bad carer not knowing much about her mental health issues and not
understanding what my role is . I am trying to learn more and more by
the day so I can get better. Recently I have strongly started to suspect
that her illness maybe depression anxiety and possible bpd. I have read
number Of articles And believe I can very much relate to the symptoms
and feelings of bpd carers. My wife sometimes does mention self harm
even though I think she uses it as a threat I am not sure if I should be
taking it seriously or not. We have recently started to see a family
councellor and I am not sure if I should tell the councellor about these
threats. I am a bit nervous that if my partner finds out about it how
she will react to me disclosing this and also her trust would be broken.
Any help would be greatly appreciated . Also I feel like I am being
blamed for everything in these sessions like any carer would be able to
relate to. Are counselling sessions of any help at all or will have have
to just accept all blame. I feel like if I tell my side of the story it
always turns into an argument . I feel like my partner is so convincing
That I end up looking like the partner who is solely at fault. I even
find more of her facts highly exaggerated .Look forward to any advice .
Thank you

                 A few days ago my ex really spiralled with her mental health, and
started shutting everyone out, including me. This happened after an
argument, and it felt like she hated me. I finally got a hold of her the
next day (we bought a house together and I stayed at my parents house),
and she told me to come back to the house to meet her. I did, and she
told me she can't do a relationship right now, that the depression is
taking up all her energy and she isn't capable of supporting someone
else's needs. She said it wasn't my fault and that maybe in the future
we can get back together. Obviously this hurt a lot, but I love her
unconditionally and gave her the space she needed. Fast forward to the
next day, my mum calls me and says that my ex would like me to live with
her as friends, and that she doesn't want to leave the house. This is
where I'm torn, I'd do anything to get her back, but knowing that this
may be a cry for help and the fact that there is a chance I could help
her get through this, even if it means putting her feelings first, makes
me want to do it. I think I'll regret it if I don't try. Any feedback or
opinions would be greatly appreciated

I don't have any orther chidren or a partner. My ex- is a good father
when he is sober, he has struggled with addiction and mental health his
whole life, but to his credit he is always trying to get better. Until
this year my daughter was not really aware of his illnesses, but as you
would know the older they get its harder to hide. We both had very age
appropiate conversations about his struggles after my ex-had a lapse
this year and crashed the car with her, luckily nothing happened. My ex
is getting help and doing well managing his recovery. I work in mental
health and addiction too, but of course when dealing with this issues in
your own home is always hard. Last year and this year my daughter got
closer to a new group of friends, one of them had a gender change (from
girl to boy) and struggles with a lot of family issues, self harming
significantly and also childhood trauma, sexual abuse. My daughter
shared this with me and I became very concerned as she seemed to feel
the need to help her friend who she said cared for very much. I asked
her to always tell me if she became concerned about her friend and to
also be careful and not get to involved, I explained that children her
age should not have to deal with such heavy topics and that her friend
was getting help from Social work services and her parents. Over the
past 4 months she seemed to get even closer and borderline obsessed with
helping and being friends with this child, I made attempts to talk to
her as I was noticing she was becoming withdrawn, sad and anxious, I let
her know I was here and explained that she needed to put some emotional
distance from her friend as I could see it affecting her. I found notes
in her room of dreams she was having about this child self harming and
being suicidal. This week another friend at school had been doing some
self harmed with razers and this was very ditressing to her and her
other friend. I called the school and my daughter also spoke to the
school counsellor. Yesterday I found she had also tried to cut herself
on her hand and wrist.I told her teacher so he is aware and I've made an
appt with a Psychologist, but appt is a few weeks away. Need some advice
please

                 Hi everyone, I’m new here. I’m Jess, mama to one little boy with
(undiagnosed) autism. We’ve started the assessment process but thanks to
covid it’s been difficult to continue. Long post warning. My son is 4,
and he’s having a hard time at daycare. And I’m just at a loss on how to
help him. He’s been at daycare for 18 months or so, has always been
great at drop off, and suddenly he’s distraught when he knows he has to
go. He was sick and missed a few weeks and once he was well enough to go
back, that’s when it all started. I think he just got comfortable being
at home? But it’s been 5 or so weeks of this now and he’s just not
improving. Once he settles in, he has a great day but the minute he
wakes up and see’s my work uniform he’s upset. He cries the whole
morning, cries on the drive there, and I often have to carry him in
while he fights and screams that he wants to go home. I don’t know what
to do anymore. He’s verbal, but doesn’t communicate super well. When I
ask why he doesn’t want to go, he just says ‘I don’t know’ or ‘I stay at
mummy’s house’. I’ve questioned the educators, wondering if he’s had an
incident with another child. Wondering if maybe he was scared of
someone? But there’s been nothing. I can’t handle the upset anymore, my
anxiety is through the roof whenever I have to work, and I’m out of
ideas. I try to stay calm and gentle with him and show positive
reinforcement but nothing is working. His dad is also finding it
difficult and has started to yell and tell him to stop it, which doesn’t
help at all so now we’re starting to fight because of it. I just wish he
could understand or explain to me why he doesn’t want to go. If you’ve
read this far, thank you. I appreciate it. I just don’t know how to help
him and I’m feeling so lost.

                 Dad is 73 yo Viet Vet w depression, anxiety &amp; chronic pain. He lives on
his own in our rental property. We’ve noticed he makes excuses for us to
not go over there, or get beyond the front door. He comes to our place
for dinners (weekly/fortnightly). We knew he had clutter &amp; was having
trouble with housework, but we were oblivious to the real problems. He
has refused to get a cleaner so assumed he was ok. A few days ago he had
a leaky shower. Our plumber couldn’t get there, so hubby went to look at
it. I went to measure a few things, because we’re planning on selling
the place soon. We were completely shocked by the filth. The clutter we
knew was there - not quite as bad as hoarders you see on tv, but bad
enough. The floors were really filthy. The kitchen floor full of old
food spills. The place full of mould &amp; his bed sheets hadn’t been
changed in years - there was mould &amp; cobwebs on his pillows. I felt
sick. We didn’t say much to Dad, I measured, my hubby fixed the taps &amp;
we headed off to our next stop, telling Dad we’d see him next weekend. I
don’t know if Dad even realises just how bad his house is. Dad went into
a bit of a panic when we told him a few weeks ago that we’d decided to
sell, so we’ve since made a plan to build a cottage on our property for
him. He’s been involved in the design of it &amp; we’ve started the process
with the builder. It is a much smaller place than he’s in right now &amp; he
agrees, he has a lot of stuff to sort through. But, he just wants to put
it in storage for now to sort later. We would like to help him in any
way we can. This cottage will be brand new, so we’re going to start off
on the right foot with him &amp; have our cleaner who comes weekly to clean
his place for him. We’ll change/wash his bed sheets every weekend, so he
doesn’t end up living in that filthy state again. He is such a proud
man; I’m certain he’s embarrassed. Does anyone have any advice or
stories to share that would be helpful in trying to help him &amp; make the
transition smooth, without literally freaking him out. We want to buy
him a new fridge &amp; bed, because his are literally covered in mould, but
I want to handle it all delicately. I’ve been reading this isn’t as
straight forward as moving him to a new place with new stuff. We can see
now that this has been going on for a while, but because he’s always
clean when we see him, we simply had no idea! I feel that it has all
just been brought on by physical incapacity through chronic pain &amp;
depression &amp; anxiety.

                 My daughter is Gifted with Autism. She also has Pathological Demand
Avoidance. And now she is very mentally unwell. Generally - when
balanced - she is a great kid, full of spunk, great sense of humour, a
real extrovert and so many love her for her wonderful empathy and
loyalty to her friends. But she has been suffering bullying now for many
years. She is 12 years old and has been bullied almost continuously for
being different since she was 7. She had her first mental breakdown at 7
years old - with psychotic episodes - violent ones that would sometimes
go for up to two hours - and she often couldn't remember them afterward.
She got help at the time through CAHMS and was put on medication - but
it is what started the bullying at school because other kids saw that
side of her. Unfortunately she couldn't live it down even when she was
better. She lost a lot of friends, and a lot of popularity.. it was very
lonely for her. After three years of intense bullying (in hindsight we
should have left the school much earlier) we changed schools. But the
damage was done. My daughter is now very reactive due to triggers - so
any kid who teases her ends up with her reacting as if it is massive
bullying. She doesn't cope with the smallest of things, and it has been
slowly getting worse. Last week she attempted suicide for he first time
and went to a depressed state that she has never had before - complete
dissassociation. Now she is slowly transitioning back to school - but
the problem is, despite all the best efforts from the teachers, and us
(setting up a safety plan) - some of the antagonisers are still bullying
her - they sneak in and say small things that make her feel even worse
about herself. This is not helping her mental health, it is making
things really hard for her. How can I stop these kids from being so
cruel? She is 12 years old. I want them to stop - I can't work out how I
can make them understand that their cruel words could lead to her badly
harming herself.. I am so afraid of her. Before anyone suggests it, I am
really spent, suffering a lot of mental health issues myself - so
homeschooling is not something I can manage, neither is unschooling - I
need respite desperately and that is the time I get it. I also need to
work two days a week to keep our income up enough to keep going. The
hospital has no room to take my daughter either, so there is nowhere but
home and school for her at the moment. Any help, anyone can give, will
be much appreciated.

                 I posted on here a few months ago and well I guess I just need to vent
or some support or just be heard , I'm not sure. My husband of 4 years
(been together 8 years) has mental health issues , he has been
hospitalized before (early 2018) for a breakdown mostly induced from
excessive use of marijuana and untreated childhood trauma. He has been
diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder but I also believe he has NPD.
We have a 2.5 year old boy who is my absolute world. The first few years
of our relationship was very tumultuous and toxic. I myself suffer from
mental health issues and anytime things got bad I would self harm(in the
past) or think of worse. I'm not that person anymore. I have grown a lot
since then and have better knowledge/tools to deal with stress/issues
etc. However, eventhough it has been years, my husband continues to
bring up the past calling me a suicidal w**re or worse names. Says he is
feeling that way now because of me and I somehow poisoned him to think
that way. I know it's not possible but there's only so many times you
can hear the same detrimental thing over and over again. The past 1.5
years he has started smoking weed again along with making bad decisions,
and he has again started being verbally and emotionally abusive towards
me to the point I need to block his messages daily as it's very
distracting at work and I'm trying to set boundaries. He blames me for
every single thing gone wrong in his life to the point of him putting on
weight, losing friends, not speaking to family, smoking weed, gambling,
being anger and having bad thoughts towards me. Calls me every single
name under the sun. And either gives me silent treatment and ignores me
or just goes off on a rant to try and break me. Because I don't like to
retaliate and cuss , I either ignore/block him or I speak to him in a
supportive manner and remind him we are his support but he constantly
calls me the devil and snake and manipulative woman. I am slowly losing
my patience and I'm just over it as now I have my child I don't have the
time or energy to waste on his toxic behaviour and by protecting myself
and ignoring him, makes me feel like I'm doing more harm towards him by
not being the constant support I always was. We are 35 years old and I
want a partner someone I can talk to, who helps without being asked ,
who is reliable and empathetic, and I am just so angry now because he is
none of it. And constantly blames me! I don't have intentions of leaving
but I'm so sad

                 Hi all, I would really appreciate some advice. My boyfriend and I have
been together about 18 months now. He was up front and honest about his
depression from the start. Throughout the relationship, I have seen
glimpses of his struggles; he would often get down due to feeling as
though he has a lack of career direction and the pressure of having 2
kids to 2 different (demanding) mothers. During those times, he has gone
quiet for a few days but it never really affected our relationship.
Around 4 weeks ago I began to notice he was started to isolate himself.
Sex was lessening, he stopped texting me throughout the day, after
dinner he would get straight on to his phone and watch netflix with
headphones in until it was time to go to sleep. Obviously this concerned
me greatly and I asked if he had had a change of heart about our
relationship. He said no, but that he had a lot going on in his head at
the moment and struggling to pinpoint the cause. He said he just needed
to work through these struggles on his own. I struggle with this as I am
an extremely affectionate person and love being intimate and love when
he says he loves me. Now it's like pulling teeth trying to get anything
remotely 'boyfriend-ish' out of him. I can see that my constant
pestering wasn't helping and I've pulled back to give him his space. We
are currently living with his parents while we renovate our new place -
I offered to go stay up at the house on a mattress on the floor for a
few days if he wanted me to, but he said no. I'm at a complete loss as
to how I'm meant to act or what he wants from me. I love him so much but
it feels so one sided at the moment. I've since done some research on
depression and know it's common for one to isolate themselves and that I
should lower my relationship expectations for the meantime. It such a
struggle though, because the insecure side of me still wonders if this
is just a lead up to him breaking it off. I'm in a constant state of
anxiety and feel like I'm walking on egg shells. He's already on anti
depressants and has been for years. I suggested that perhaps he should
seek out therapy, and he just brushed it off. I think the hardest part
of all this is not knowing when (or if) this depressive episode will
end, and when the man I know and love will come back to me. Thanks in
advance

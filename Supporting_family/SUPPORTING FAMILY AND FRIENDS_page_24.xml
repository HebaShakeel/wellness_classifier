                 This list has been compiled from experiences supporting my husband with
depression. There is no one size fits all, so please take what you are
comfortable with based on your circumstances and resources. 1. Reach out
to family and/or friends to feel supported - this also covers support
groups - online or face to face. Don't let stigma stop you from reaching
out. 2. Relationship boundaries - identify what is acceptable and not.
My general platform is that physical abuse is unacceptable as well as
regular demeaning/berating comments. Communicate this openly so everyone
understands. 3. Coping tools - this could be exercise, meditation,
reading a book, meeting friends, etc. They are important for your mental
health. 4. Knowledge is power - research to understand about depression.
The more you know, the better care you can provide. 5. Remember your
partner in the good times - this is their true selves, not the darkness.
6. Listen and show receptivity - without judgement or anger. If
communicate becomes strained, the timeout can provide clarity. Encourage
communication gently and try not to push. 7. Seek counselling - sharing
your feelings can provide an opportunity to off load the heavy stuff and
identify resilience and coping strategies. 8. Work as a team - don't let
mental illness be in the driver's seat. Offer to go to the Dr's and
support them. Understand medication and side effects. Be understanding
that some days are harder than others. 9. Words are powerful - remember
what you say cannot be taken back. 10. Carer Self-esteem and self-worth
- if you compromise these for the sake of supporting your partner, you
are likely to live with resentment towards your partner and the
circumstances you find yourself in. 11. Don't forget the children -
challenging circumstances at home can affect them mentally and
emotionally. Speak about mental illness (COPMI.com.au - has some great
resources) and be a strong foundation toward maintaining normality in
their daily activities. 12. Intimacy - there are many variables here, so
from my experience - keep communication open and make couple time to
connect. When my husband was depressed, daily hugs or holding hands
wherever possible worked for us. Some carers I have spoken with said
their partner would demand intimacy. My personal position is that
intimacy is about love without demands or attachments relating to
expectation. Demands only deplete the goodness in the connection and
sharing a a loving experience. [Moderator's note: this thread is for

                 My 20 yo daughter has suffered with anxiety/depression since high school
and I feel that she isn't getting the right kind of help. She told me a
year or so ago that she was convinced that she had BPD. She started
seeing a psychologist (who she said she didn't like and that she
couldn't talk to) through her GP and pushed to see a psychiatrist so
that she could get a diagnosis. She got an appointment and was told she
had traits of BPD. She was super angry about this and insisted to me
that it was full BPD and pushed to join a group to get treatment. I feel
that she has convinced herself that she has this condition and knows how
to answer questions accordingly. She now uses the condition as an excuse
for her behaviour and constantly tells me that I don't understand and
that I need to learn more about her condition and cut her some slack.
She constantly blames me if we argue and I feel like I'm constantly
walking on eggshells. She has seen various psychologists and never seems
to be happy with them. She has just started seeing a new psychiatrist
and I feel like the treatment she is receiving is counter productive.
She is becoming increasingly self obsessed and selfish, and constantly
tells me that nothing is her fault and she 'has a mental health
condition' and that I 'should be more supportive'. I have tried so so
hard over the last few years and this has nearly broken me. I feel like
my daughter has anger issues and that the direction that she is going in
is completely wrong. I wish I could talk to her current psychiatrist ask
him to start from scratch and fully assess her from scratch but I know I
cant. I'm so frustrated and I just don't know how to help her move
forward and stop making excuses for her behaviour. I want to support her
in the best way that I can but we just seem to be stuck in this rut
where I think she is using her 'BPD' as an excuse for anger and attitude
and she thinks that I'm ignorant and need to be educated on BPD and what
she is going through. Can anyone relate? I really need to know if I'm
dealing with this the right way or not. Thanks x

                 My partner he is almost 49. Many years ago is when I first noticed
strange things. Example like about 6 years ago or so he left the glass
sliding door open on our Lizard enclosure. Miraculously none got out and
no cats got in there. Another time he did it again and it was left open
all night. Thankfully they were fine. That Christmas Eve when we were
wrapping presents he asked me how do we spell our sons name... I was
like are you joking ? He said no he is just tired and cannot think
straight. Since then he often does strange things like he could at times
walk out the front door and walk straight back in and says he forgot to
put his shoes on, early morning getting ready for work. At times he will
leave his coffee left in the coffee machine or a drink on the bench he
forgot to take. He has misplaced his mobile phone a few times, even lost
a work PDA that costed us around $800 or so (that was about 4 years ago)
When talking he forgets peoples names, other day we were talking about
wood... and the local place he goes to at times he forgot what it was
called and when I said oh I think it is Home Timber Hardware, he clicks
his fingers and says "that's the one, thank you" That and so many other
things is exactly like my father, who had serious dementia and is now
passed away. There is so many damn instances with my partner that seem
so very similar to my father, in stages of my father's dementia. MY
partner says there is nothing wrong with him, his brain or memory. He
did eventually go see a GP He did a small test then and there and he had
blood tests lot's of various ones also a Brain scan which costed us few
hundreds. All were fine. The Doctor said everything seems fine and that
a brain scan does not always show any signs of dementiaRight so here we
are and he is not any better and some what a little worse in some ways
then before. He often does struggle to think of words when talking
whether it is someones name or a place or even the name of his power
tools he uses often.... this is far from normal. I believe sometimes he
is not even aware of lapsed time, that he could be outside for a good 8
hours on a weekend and not really notice he was. He always is very
tired, he looks buggered, something does not seem right, look right.
Some days I think I imagine it, then other days I am certain something
is very off. Only previous known medical issues is, pollops (not sure on
that spelling) in the nose and 2 years ago diagnosed with barrett's
esophagusWhat do I do ?

                 Hi all my husband of almost 11 years has been suffering with depression
and anxiety for the last year. I wasn’t fully aware of how bad it had
got and now he has hit rock bottom. Back story - we recently signed up
to build our 1st family home. literally from the moment we signed we
have had nothing but issues , and increases in the price. I think that
this has been the main trigger for my husbands depression , with the
pressure he is under to support his family as well as come up with
almost $30k extra for this house before it’s complete . I don’t work , I
wanted to work but with 3 of our kids being under school age , it would
mean having to pay 3 day care fees and with him being fifo and earning
too much we don’t get much CCS from Centrelink so he said it was
pointless, I now no that I need to be working to help him by taking some
of this financial burden from him. I feel terrible that it has got this
bad. This all came out last week when he told me he know longer loved me
and didn’t want to be with me anymore. I am absolutely devastated. he
has also said that he has no love for himself and also our kids which
killed him to admit and he hates himself even more for this . I have
told him it’s not him, it’s the depression. I have told him that I am
going to support him and I am going to get him better . I have told him
that I will not give up on him or us. He wants me to help him and he has
told me that he wants to love me but he feels dead inside , feels
worthless and he just can’t see a way back from his depression. I am
struggling everyday with my feelings, terrified that even if he is able
to get out of this dark place , there will still be no love for me there
and I will have to go through this heart ache again. I tell him every
day I love him and he says he likes to know that I haven’t given up on
him. He can’t say it back though as he doesn’t want to lie to me He
feels he may have BPD , so I have said I will get him an app with his
GP. He is on medication, which has just been increased . I just want him
to get better and back to how he was last year before this house ruined
his head . I have contacted Centrelink and filed as a single parent
which is killing me to say, now I need to find a job so I can help with
paying this money that is weighing him down , in hope that he may start
to feel the pressure on him lift . I know it’s going to be a long
journey . Any advise welcome x Rachel x

                 My partner has been struggling pretty much since 2020 – the usual
suspects, anxiety at first, then depression, then very bad depression,
then substance use issues. He was recently diagnosed with adhd, which
makes a lot of sense, and is a good thing because it means he can get
medication that could be life-changing. I really hope it is, and I know
he really, really hopes it is. I don’t even know how to start to talk
about how I’m feeling. I feel stressed. I feel overwhelmed. I feel
emotionally tapped out. I feel bad to admit that I am relieved when he
leaves the house, and bummed out when he comes home. The
unpredictability of his moods has left me feeling like I can’t relax,
can hardly think about anything else. It feels a bit like what I read in
this book once, that a partner said about their mentally ill spouse –
when they’re in the room, there’s no oxygen left for me. I just… feel so
totally burned out. I’ve tried to tell them. But it’s not easy to do –
or hear. They’ve described themselves as being in survival mode, just
trying to make it through the day, and feeling as though they’re in the
lowest point of their lives. They see light at the end of the tunnel
with the prospect of medication – the gravity of everything being put on
medication working is a thought a bit too terrifying for me to consider
fully. Today I told them I'm overwhelmed, I feel tapped out. I think
they took it as I’m just tired today. What I didn’t tell them, and
probably never could, is that I'm barely able to hear them talk about
themselves anymore. It’s all day. Every day. Every hour. I feel like a
round-the-clock coach or therapist. There are no breaks. There are
sometimes break-throughs, and these initially sparked so much relief and
hope in me. But I’ve been on the rollercoaster so long now, that I just
feel exhausted all of the time. It's this, every day, on rotation, like
a stuck record playing happy, sad, angry, hopeful, and hopeless songs at
total random: “I hate my life, I don’t want to be alive.” “I’m going to
do great things one day.” “I don’t care about anything, I don’t like
anything, everything is boring and I just want to be put to sleep.” “I’m
feeling pretty good right now.” “Why me?” “I appreciate everything you
do for me, and I’m sorry.” His words have gravity, even when they don't
– every interaction is filled with so much weight, and I want to cry at
the pressure.

                 Hi all I am on my phone so apologies if this doesn't read well. I am
typing this while trying not to raise the suspicion of my wife who is
becoming extremely paranoid. She has never had mental health issues
before but over the past month she has been getting increasingly
delusional and paranoid. At this stage she is unable to relax and spends
all day wrapped up in various causes of concern, none of which have any
proof. This began with falsely accusing me of infidelity, but has gotten
worse. To be specific, at this stage: - she thinks her phone has been
hacked and is being monitored - she thinks hidden cameras are filming
her - she thinks I've been communicating "private information" about our
lives with others, and that it's gone viral on the internet This is
getting worse. I took her to the GP who asked for a blood test to rule
out any dietary causes (she hasn't been eating much). I am convinced
this is something much more sinister and that she needs to be medicated
immediately. We got the blood test and need to follow up with the GP,
but he's not available again until next week. Am i just stressing out
wanting to move fast on this or is my intuition valid? Can we afford to
wait until Monday to have the doctor look at her blood test? I have no
idea what to do and the longer this goes on i am scared of her getting
worse.

                 Hi. Warning long post. First timer here and talking about this outside
of my head. My husband has been a ‘good’ drinker most of his life but
last few years it’s become his ‘go to’ for the good, bad and ugly. He
turns into a different person which makes me really angry and
frustrated. Also over the last few years, he (and we) have had a really
hard time with loss, hardship and general ‘everyday life’ frustration.
We have 3 kids which also plays into the mix. Throw Covid into that as
well. Recently he’s had some health issues which we are currently
sorting out but this obviously all contributes to each other. He has had
the occasional suicidal comment which is when I realised I (he) really
should’ve done something a long time ago. It’s not only affecting me but
the kids and our marriage. He is great in the mornings and during the
day, but it start when he is home at night, it all goes downhill. He
knows he needs to get help but won’t actually do anything or talk to
anyone. How do I get him to at least talk to a professional? Thanks for
reading.

son has come to me and opened up about how he is suffering from
depression and anxiety, and to be honest I don't know what to do. He has
always been a shy kid growing up, but has really come out of his shell
in the last few years and is one of the most amazing and beautiful
people you will ever meet. To be honest he is my step son, not that it
makes a shred of difference. He has lived with us for nearly 10 years
and has no contact with his mum, (just for back story). In my opinion
his issues start from his parents splitting up, compounded by lots of
other small issues. A year ago he reached out and said he was feeling
over whelmed and depressed and I thought it was just a feeling during a
stressful period, but I now realise that was him crying out.. and I feel
devestated that I missed the sign and didn't follow it up. A few weeks
ago he came to me again, the new year rolled in and he said he didn't
want to live with this by himself anymore, he wanted to be open and
start dealing with it, so we have been talking a lot, I have been
looking up amazing forums and pages/sites like this to try and learn as
much as I can so I know how to help him. My amazing sister suffers the
same, and although she goes through her own struggle she has been so
helpful in keeping me calm and educating me from her perspective. We
went to the local gp yesterday and they have prescribed him medication,
as well as starting counselling asap, the thing is I'm so new to this, I
guess I have always been a bit old fashioned believing that counselling
and dealing with issues is more effective then medication. I guess I'm
asking about other people's situations. I'm scared to put him on
medication, however what is the alternative? I found him sitting under a
noose he had hung up in the garage, and can not describe how heart
broken and devestated I am. I dont know where to go from here, but know
that I need to be strong for him to help him as much as I can. He is the
love of my life, the most amazing and generous person, and im so shocked
that this has been brewing under the surface for so long. Thank you for
listening, and I hope to hear from anyone at all x

                 Hi All, Please excuse my grammar and spelling but my mind seems to be a
mush. I have a 22year old son who is struggling badly with anxiety. For
the past three months he has had no job. He had to leave because he
doesn't want to be vaccinated. He said he will apply for 'Remote work
from home' positions, which he did for a little while but with each
knock back he has had, the more reluctant he is to try again. He has
finally applied for jobseeker and was thinking of doing a course but now
he isn't so sure. He says what's the point of doing a course if you
aren't really interested in the subject. I've tried to encourage him
towards something he does like but he can only find a negative outcome.
He doesn't want to work. He is happy at home. He said there is no point
in working for the next 30 years to be miserable. I've told him over and
over again that I don't care what kind of job he has. Full time or part
time. Just something. How can I help him to see the positive sides of
life,getting a job, having friendship's, relationships? He does exercise
in our shed four times a week, which is fantastic but I want him to want
more to life. Is that a bad thing? I know it is extremely hard for him.
It is also extremely hard for myself and my husband. I'm I expecting to
much? I'm I thinking more of my needs than his. Please help.

                 Hi there, So the backstory for this situation is that I play dungeons
and dragons (DND) with some friends that I made online. If you're
unfamiliar with DND, it's a game where a group of people collaboratively
tell a story together and decide the outcomes of the story by rolling
dice. One person (me) takes on the role of the narrator of the story and
drives the main plot forward and the other people take on the role of
one specific character each (the protagonists of the story). After we
had a couple of sessions one person started to no-show with no
explanation why. He would confirm he could make it a week in advance and
then at the time of the session would just not log in to the video call
and wouldn't respond to messages. Then when I would follow up with him
in the days after he would profusely apologise and explain that mental
health issues prevented him from attending. I've offered him a lot of
support. The only thing I've asked is that if he's not feeling up to a
session, please just let me know, no matter how late notice. I'd never
be upset with him for cancelling if he just told me that he couldn't
make it. So that brings us to now, he attended a session 3 weeks back
and had a great time. Then he missed the following session with no
explanation. I gave him a few days and reached out to him and he told me
he had a complete breakdown and checked himself into the mental health
unit and only just got out. I'm extremely worried about him hearing that
and want to give him all the support possible, but I'm at an impasse.
The rest of the group is getting quite frustrated that he is no-showing
and, to be frank, I spend many hours a week writing stories for his
character that end up getting thrown in the bin because he doesn't show
up, which is frustrating for me. So I want to keep offering him support
but I want to set a boundary here. The rest of the group is at the end
of their rope and have asked that if he no-shows one more time that I
remove him from the group and we find someone else to play with. They
are somewhat aware of his circumstances but he hasn't disclosed his
latest troubles to them and I don't feel it's my place to share
something like this with them without his permission. I'm equally
frustrated with his no-showing but when he does show he genuinely has a
great time and I don't want to take something that he truly enjoys away
from him. Does anyone have any advice on how to set a boundary with him,
without just abandoning him?

                 I know the title sounds kind of weird but hear me out. Long story short,
my mother lives quite far from us so that prevents me from being there
for her and giving support in certain ways. Her emotional situation as I
understand (via my half-brother that lives with her) is that she is very
depressed and her and my stepdad fight really bad and really often. they
have 4 kids, youngest being 9 so for her it is out of the question to
leave. The main issue is she has been struggling with depression and
anxiety I think her whole adult life, she hasn't had a job since she had
me and I'm 25... She also doesn't drive because she doesn't have anyone
who can help her learn in the right way (as this also gives her intense
anxiety). I would really like to help her find a job, but she is so
disadvantaged and fragile. She probably would take anything but also she
has been very isolated and I think the easier to get customer service
jobs would really overwhelm her and not be great for her mental health.
Does anyone have any advice for me on what to do? is there any services
that might help her? What jobs might be useful? I also struggle with
anxiety and depression and feel so incredibly overwhelmed by this

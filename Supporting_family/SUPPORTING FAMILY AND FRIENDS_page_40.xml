                 This list has been compiled from experiences supporting my husband with
depression. There is no one size fits all, so please take what you are
comfortable with based on your circumstances and resources. 1. Reach out
to family and/or friends to feel supported - this also covers support
groups - online or face to face. Don't let stigma stop you from reaching
out. 2. Relationship boundaries - identify what is acceptable and not.
My general platform is that physical abuse is unacceptable as well as
regular demeaning/berating comments. Communicate this openly so everyone
understands. 3. Coping tools - this could be exercise, meditation,
reading a book, meeting friends, etc. They are important for your mental
health. 4. Knowledge is power - research to understand about depression.
The more you know, the better care you can provide. 5. Remember your
partner in the good times - this is their true selves, not the darkness.
6. Listen and show receptivity - without judgement or anger. If
communicate becomes strained, the timeout can provide clarity. Encourage
communication gently and try not to push. 7. Seek counselling - sharing
your feelings can provide an opportunity to off load the heavy stuff and
identify resilience and coping strategies. 8. Work as a team - don't let
mental illness be in the driver's seat. Offer to go to the Dr's and
support them. Understand medication and side effects. Be understanding
that some days are harder than others. 9. Words are powerful - remember
what you say cannot be taken back. 10. Carer Self-esteem and self-worth
- if you compromise these for the sake of supporting your partner, you
are likely to live with resentment towards your partner and the
circumstances you find yourself in. 11. Don't forget the children -
challenging circumstances at home can affect them mentally and
emotionally. Speak about mental illness (COPMI.com.au - has some great
resources) and be a strong foundation toward maintaining normality in
their daily activities. 12. Intimacy - there are many variables here, so
from my experience - keep communication open and make couple time to
connect. When my husband was depressed, daily hugs or holding hands
wherever possible worked for us. Some carers I have spoken with said
their partner would demand intimacy. My personal position is that
intimacy is about love without demands or attachments relating to
expectation. Demands only deplete the goodness in the connection and
sharing a a loving experience. [Moderator's note: this thread is for

I'm supposed to support him, not judge him, not tell him what to do. On
the other I'm supposed to "not enable" him. I don't understand what I'm
supposed to do in this situation. He says it's because he is just not
enjoying it, doesn't like how long the hours are, and doesn't how hard
the work is. I understand all of that. But he was excited for this job
for weeks, and has wanted to do it since he was a kid. It's been one
week employed after years of unemployment, and he suddenly doesn't like
it? I think he is just intimidated, but I don't know how to tell him
that without being 'unsupportive'. Also, if he leaves, I know he'll go
to bed for days and avoid his family and repeat over and over what a
screw up he is and how much he regrets leaving it.. We went through this
about 2 months ago, when he quit that job before his day. It was so, so,
so emotionally and psychologically exhausting being in this house with
him after that. I do not want to go through it again... But I can never
tell him that

                 Hi, I am a little stuck with what I should do. My partner is suffering
from deep depression and anxiety and when he is in a bad way he blames
it all on me saying I don’t know how to uplift him and putting up with
someone who isn’t supportive is the hardest thing he has to do, and says
that I have no common sense about life and that makes him nervous
because how can he be with someone who can’t help or protect us in the
future (we have been together 6 years) ... as I’m typing this I am
making him sound awful and I admit that it can be but maybe I am not
doing or saying the right things to help ? he is the type of person who
keeps to himself and I’m all he has, when I try to get him to do things
to get out and about he says why do I want to be like everyone else on
social media etc.. he is a very fit person physically but his mentally
is a different story.. I don’t know how to say the right thing to help
him see better things in life... I’m really struggling because his
depression is being taken out on me emotionally and I’m become too tired
to try and then it just goes in a circle back to me not knowing what to
say and being unable to help him when really I’m just tired because I
have tried and he doesn’t see or listen

                 Hi everyone I need to say that I love my wife, but its getting to the
stage where I am wondering it it worth my own happiness, health and
mental well being. I have a 7 year old daughter to consider as well as
my comfortable life I have worked hard all my life and will more than
likely lose to her if we ever split. I am not a quitter, I am willing
and do support her, she has absolutely no money worries at all, I pay
for everything, house luxury car and utilities, the lot. She just left
her 2 day a week job because it was making her depressed and sick. I do
9 hours a day including a half day Saturday to keep my business going,
all that is expected from her is to pick up and drop off our daughter
from school and be a mother. What has happened over the years is we have
drifted apart, communication has broken down. All I get from her in any
discussion is negativity, how I dont spend enough time with her and our
daughter, how I tune out and surf the net on the laptop instead of
talking. When I get told about all the things I do wrong it is easier to
just shut up then to argue. Heaven forbid if was to argue back. If there
is a worse possible way to take something then that is the way she takes
it. I never judge her or demand anything from her yet if I make a
comment like "gee that chicken you cooked was spicy" she would reply
with something along the lines "I know its not good enough for you, or I
cant ever get any thing right for you. I am often wondering "where did
that come from". She is cranky and moody, she screams at our daughter
and carries on about anything that is asked of her. Today I tried to
make a bit of fun and she came at me with a water bottle I put my hands
over my face, and she hit me accross the stomach. I have never hit her,
I have never started a physical fight with anyone. I could see hatred in
her eyes. When I met her I was her instructor/helper at a ballroom dance
studio with I had been attending for a few years, I was fit, happy and
successful because after some lows in my life I chose to be that way.
Now I am happiest at work doing my thing, I have no close friends
anymore, dont want to go anywhere, I am unfit and I am probably mildly
depressed myself. She has had a stint in hospital to change meds
recently (5 weeks) Do you think she is Just depressed, or with the nasty
moody attitude do you think there is more to it? Am I doing anything
wrong ? As soon as I try to get close to her I get pushed away.

think this is because she doesn't feel she is worthy of my love and
support. I'm trying to be as supportive as I can, just by offering to
listen if she needs to talk. Sometimes she comes good again and
apologises and says she did not mean to take it out on me. She is not in
a position to seek therapy at the moment and has an unsupportive family.
Any suggestions on what I do when she says she does not want me in her
life? I'm scared that would tip her over the edge, as I seem to be her
only support.

                 Hello, My best friend has bipolar disorder. Our friendship has been
great. lately she has become verbally abusive, angry and she shuts me
out and I can’t respond. She accuses me of being a liar, manipulator,
attention seeker and someone with an agenda and selective memory., All I
have ever done is treat her kindly. We talked about food, she made
suggestions worth doing, since I was only eating vegetables, legumes.
The conversation ended amicably. The next morning, she went ballistic
and said some verbally abusive things which hurt. I became a liar
because I followed her suggestion, it seems. She told me to leave her
alone otherwise she would terminate our friendship. She has qualities
which to me are very rare. I care about her very much. I am a kind,
caring but a passive individual, never spoken ill of her, never put her
down or commented on her shortcomings or actions, but she appears to be
overanalysing our discussions to look for possible faults or
shortcomings of my own for some reason, misunderstanding what is being
communicated or is just saying them to hurt me. She often puts herself
down, and I counter it by trying to boost her. She deserves it. The last
time something like this happened , which was her getting angry because
I apologised to her because I thought I upset her. It turned out was
joking but I misunderstood. I was also called a liar then because she
felt my apology was false or pretend. I genuinely felt I’d said
something wrong and upset her, and felt remorseful. She stormed off and
said she needed space. I have never known anyone to react to apologies
with hostility. I waited two weeks and it was like nothing happened and
she apologised to me for not being chatty, even though she was the one
that wanted me to leave her alone. The normality didn’t last long,
though. She knows she needs a mood stabiliser but hasn’t done anything.
I researched bipolar because she knew basically nothing. After being
triggered off over a discussion about food, I do not know how to
approach her, or when, in fear of having her rage at me again. She’s
right though, I *do* have an agenda. When I got to know her, I realised
how bad her depression is and how badly if affects her life. I wanted to
try and put some happiness, relief, normalcy back into her life. I want
her to be happy, because I care about her. I’ve never expected anything
from her other than her friendship and company. Any advice gratefully
received. Thank you.

                 Hi All, I've been thinking of joining a forum like this for quiet some
time and it's been really encouraging reading other people's posts. I
really just needed a place to be able to communicate how I'm feeling as
I can't always be so blunt with my partner. I started seeing him about 7
months ago and right from the start he told me that he has depression
(his parents and siblings all have it too) and he has managed it for
years through medication and counseling. I met him during a good period
for him where he was feeling really on top of it but about a month into
our relationship, he got demoted at work and decided to quite his job.
It sent him into a depressive episode which has lasted about 6 months
now. We love each other and he is pretty good at communicating with me
about how he's feeling (which I appreciate) and he is still getting
treatment. But it's really draining for me some days and recently (the
longer this episode lasts) I have more and more days where I just wish
that we could go on a date and spend time together without the
depression. It seeps into everything. Even when he's not feeling flat
(which is rare), he's always so tired and when we're out together I'm
always so conscious of how he is feeling. It's tiring always having to
carefully choose my words when we talk about his depression, because
often when I tell him what I need, he feels like he's not good enough
for me and he won't be able to meet my needs and sometimes he feels
attacked. So I'm always having to cushion my words and beat around the
bush, when sometimes I just want to be blunt and honest about how hard
this is for me even though I know it must be so hard for him too. I'm
about to start a new job as a teacher and I'm so excited. I really feel
like I've found my passion and he's been so supportive of me. But it's
also hard being with someone who doesn't feel excitement and happiness
the way I do and sometimes I just really want him to be excited with me.
I feel so selfish for wanting that, because I know that he can't help
how he feels and he has been so supportive. I really do love him and
there are days when I really do see a wonderful future with him. I am
doing my best to support him and understand his depression. But there
are so many days when he just can't meet me where I'm at. When I tell
him I love him and see a future for us and he tells me he's emotionally
numb. It's so hard! Anyways, I know there is a light at the end of the
tunnel!

                 Hi all, I have never asked for help like this before but I am running
out of options. My husband of 12 years is an alchoholic and I feel I
have run out of options on how to help him and how to cope myself. By
day he is a charming, kind, successful man and by night he drinks until
he blacks out and is tired, dark and aggressive along the way. He can’t
remember the things he says and does. I have been keeping a journal of
his ‘incidences’ and they are so shocking I can’t re read them. My
family knows I’m in trouble and I feel so guilty for letting it go on
and on but I feel trapped and powerless. I feel like I’m slowly going
insane living in constant fear of his drinking and dysfunctional
outbursts. It effects everything in my life as I’m constantly devastated
or picking up the pieces (literally). I don’t know what else to do. I
have tried banning alchohol, tipping it out, withholding funds, telling
family and friends about his drunken behavior, yelling and screaming at
him, kicking him out of the house, couples counseling, threatened to go
to the police and even moved the family next door to my mum so she can
help me/us with his alchoholism. He has tried medications, AA,
psychologists, psychiatrists, abstinence, cognitive behavioral therapy.
He has been saying for years that he will go to rehab but it hasn’t
happened. He has no reason be be an alchoholic, no history of trauma etc
just long term alcohol abuse. Am I missing something here? We love each
other dearly and haven’t been able to leave him but Is this my only
option???

                 Im new here but feeling very out of my depth and hoping for some
supportive words from those who have been here before. My husband has
been having issues for quite some time, our family has encountered some
pretty traumatic losses over the last 5-6 years and his way of dealing
with things has been to literally through himself into work and
essentially make himself as busy as he possibly can. However things had
been getting steadily worse over the last couple weeks with several
friends and family starting to also get very worried before he finally
crashed at the beginning of the week. I made him an appointment with the
gp who wanted him sent to hospital and ended up keeping him in the
surgery for a good 2+ hours before allowing him to come home on a trial
basis provided he doesn't drive (suicidal thoughts) and daily
appointments with her. Since home I'm having to physically supervise his
medication usage and he has now decided he was just having a couple bad
days and it's all a lot of fuss over nothing. Saying that though at
today's appointment the moment we got to the drs he shut down, started
shaking, couldn't string his words together and was a complete mess,
then tried to deny it all 10 minutes after we left. Im not a complete
stranger to mental health issues, our daughter has severe anxiety and I
lost my dad to suicide 3 years ago and while I'm thankful he at least is
getting help I'm terrified it won't be enough, or that I'll crack under
the pressure and I even found myself hiding his tablets earlier today
when I had to duck out of the house briefly. We have been told it could
be a minimum of 3 weeks before we start seeing improvements and thats
provided this first choice of medications actually work for him, so any
words of advice to help me get through this first stage? Noting he
doesn't want anyone to know and while I don't agree (especially in
regards to his mum who would be incredibly supportive) I want to respect
those wishes so other than his work who witnessed the crash and my boss,
so I had flexibility no one else knows so limited real life people to
lean on at the moment.

                 My partner and I have been together for 10 years (not married) and he's
always struggled with varying severity of depression over this time. I
supported him to see a psychiatrist years ago and he's been medicated
since then, but he has always refused counselling so his management
strategies haven't improved. I developed a chronic pain condition a few
years ago as well and it's reduced my capabilities a lot. This past year
he's slowly spiralled down again; he's having sleep problems, more bouts
of being unable to communicate and struggling to get through the day. He
is tired all the time and hates his job, but is scared to quit or lose
it since it would be hard to find another now. I think me being sick too
has a bit to do with the pressure he feels there. He hasn't seen his
psychiatrist in 12 months and has been getting medication through
various GPs. I tried the same approach that worked to initially get him
to see a psychiatrist initially, but he says he's too tired to even go
to one appointment and doesn't think he can deal with talking to a
psychologist in a useful way. I've spoken to him about it 3 times now
but he just won't or can't move past that point and the conversation
just makes him sadder. I try to avoid doing things that bother him and
be emotionally supportive but I've been struggling to balance his needs
against mine. I'm worried that he will keep sliding until he can't work
anymore and then have a huge crash but nothing I say trumps over his
feelings of exhaustion. I really don't know what to do at this point so
any suggestions would be great.

a few years. We are not living together. He had been really loving and
supportive until November last year when he went distant suddenly.
Around Christmas, he took some time off work, I found he became happier
and more talkative, but it wasn’t quite the same as before. In the last
few weeks, I can feel he has been pulling away again. I was really hurt.
He even said at some stage he just wanted to be friends, but would like
to help me and support me whenever I needed it. I found his words
couldn't add up and I could tell there was something he wasn't telling
me. Just a week ago, I noticed he was taking antidepressant. Now
everything seems to make sense. I’m not quite sure what his condition is
as he has never mentioned it to me. But he did mention in the past that
he gets panic attacks. Work had been quite stressful for him in the past
few years. And at the beginning of this year he started working in a new
organisation. I have read a lot online about depression and anxiety in
the last week and I really want to be there for him. He doesn't have any
friends and his family is far away. He tends to keep a lot to himself
and very self sufficient. The fact that he’s taking antidepressant is
kind of good news as I wasn’t sure if he would want to seek any
professional help in situations like this. We used to text each other a
lot everyday when we are apart. But now he has stopped texting me to say
hi. When I text him, he responds, but wouldn't say much. He just doesn't
sound like the happy, funny guy I used to text to. He has also stopped
showing affection. When I'm with him, he acts quite normally (he even
laughs sometimes), and we still have sex, but I can tell he doesn't want
to be emotionally intimate. As he has never mentioned to me he has
depression and/or anxiety, I'm not sure if it is appropriate to start a
conversation about it bluntly, or should I be more gentle? Also I'm not
sure what to do in general. Should I just accept the way he is right
now? Is it ok to ask for more affection? I know I need to be strong and
not take anything personally, but still, when he is so distant it hurts
and makes me doubt his love for me. Any suggestions would be
appreciated.

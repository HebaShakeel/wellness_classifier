                 This list has been compiled from experiences supporting my husband with
depression. There is no one size fits all, so please take what you are
comfortable with based on your circumstances and resources. 1. Reach out
to family and/or friends to feel supported - this also covers support
groups - online or face to face. Don't let stigma stop you from reaching
out. 2. Relationship boundaries - identify what is acceptable and not.
My general platform is that physical abuse is unacceptable as well as
regular demeaning/berating comments. Communicate this openly so everyone
understands. 3. Coping tools - this could be exercise, meditation,
reading a book, meeting friends, etc. They are important for your mental
health. 4. Knowledge is power - research to understand about depression.
The more you know, the better care you can provide. 5. Remember your
partner in the good times - this is their true selves, not the darkness.
6. Listen and show receptivity - without judgement or anger. If
communicate becomes strained, the timeout can provide clarity. Encourage
communication gently and try not to push. 7. Seek counselling - sharing
your feelings can provide an opportunity to off load the heavy stuff and
identify resilience and coping strategies. 8. Work as a team - don't let
mental illness be in the driver's seat. Offer to go to the Dr's and
support them. Understand medication and side effects. Be understanding
that some days are harder than others. 9. Words are powerful - remember
what you say cannot be taken back. 10. Carer Self-esteem and self-worth
- if you compromise these for the sake of supporting your partner, you
are likely to live with resentment towards your partner and the
circumstances you find yourself in. 11. Don't forget the children -
challenging circumstances at home can affect them mentally and
emotionally. Speak about mental illness (COPMI.com.au - has some great
resources) and be a strong foundation toward maintaining normality in
their daily activities. 12. Intimacy - there are many variables here, so
from my experience - keep communication open and make couple time to
connect. When my husband was depressed, daily hugs or holding hands
wherever possible worked for us. Some carers I have spoken with said
their partner would demand intimacy. My personal position is that
intimacy is about love without demands or attachments relating to
expectation. Demands only deplete the goodness in the connection and
sharing a a loving experience. [Moderator's note: this thread is for

                 What is my role now? I've done all the things i can think of. I've gone
through the process of researching and organising therapists more times
than I can count, but he needs to talk to them to make the appointment,
and hasn't. I've invited him out of the house daily, he doesn't want to
go. I've tried encouraging him to go to work (he does uber, sometimes)
but he won't. I've even told him I need him to do something because it's
too hard for me to hear about how he hates himself and hates his life
and wishes he could run away or stop living. So what do I do now?
Background: My partner is depressed, and has immense shame about being
unemployed and being depressed, and has no motivation to go to therapy
or exercise or eat well, and it's all an awful deep cycle. He's been
smoking weed to cope and isn't sure if it's helping or not, neither am
I. On one hand, it's sometimes the only time of the day he'll laugh and
seem happy or relaxed. On the other hand, he has shame about that too
since he now feels like a "drug addict". It's like everything makes him
feel shame and self-hatred. He regularly says he feels shame because of
society and like a drain because he's on welfare, and that he wishes he
could live in a windowless box alone where nobody would know he existed.
When I tell him this is stigma he's internalised, and that he didn't
choose this, and that there are millions like him, he says he doesn't
want to talk about it any more and shuts me out. When I ask him to go to
therapy he says he can't be bothered trying. He says he can't be
bothered doing anything ever again. He says he doesnt care enough about
anything and that he just wants to hide so he can stop letting people
down. He says he's embarassed and he's a burden. When I point out the
depression is that voice and those thoughts aren't facts, he shuts me
out. So... some days I trick myself into believing he's fine. If he's
getting high and overeating and avoiding responsibilities, but he laughs
once or doesn't mention feeling like shit, then I can at least not be
absorbed in concern and heart ache that day. If he mentions hating
himself, it's like a kick to my chest and I feel miserably helpless.
Nothing I am saying or doing is making a difference, so I just hear that
and have to walk around with it. What do I do now? I can't do anything?
If I just focus on me, keeping my health in order, and enjoying moments
in my day, does this make me selfish because he is in the corner feeling
almost suicidal?

                 Hi There For the first time in 2 decades I believe my partner is
suffering from depression. The things being said and the behaviours all
are signs. I’ve also been told that our marriage is over, there is no
joy or desire or will to fight for it. There is no official diagnosis
yet but I’m very confident it’s depression of some kind. So I’m really
confused. I’m hurt because our marriage has been ended without warning
and I want to fix it and bring us closer and reconnect. But my partner
has said that’s not what they want. How can I provide help and support
and love and care and confirm that I won’t let go without fighting for
them and us, when I’m being pushed away and told to give space and
separation? I feel like if I stay away it’s confirming that I don’t want
to help or fix our marriage.

                 Hi, I have spent this morning reading posts and replies and already feel
reassured and not alone any more. I have admired the courage and
resilience of those that post and the compassion and wisdom of those
that reply. What a safe environment has been created here. My first
enquiry is about how to support and encourage my 17 year old daughter
after her confronting but apparently helpful experience of a 3 week
residential in a youth program. She is highly intelligent but has
managed to scoop the pool as far as diagnoses go - ASD, ADD, ODD,
depression, anxiety and probable bipolar. She has spent years masking
but found high school socially disasterous and academically unfulfilling
or irrelevant. We've always been open and positive about her autism
diagnosis but she resents it and resists any sort of help or therapy.
When teenage insecurities kicked in things really got difficult, and
confusing for her. She isolated herself on line, identifying as a man
and a vegetarian on the same day - vegetarian lasted 2 days, being trans
lasted 3 weeks. She projects all her issues onto her parents and will
cut off anyone who disagrees with her, including her older sister who
she used to admire so much. After a domestic violence incident her
psychiatrist recommended a clinic stay as a circuit breaker where she
had a built in social life, plenty of structure and few expectations
placed on her and she also stopped communication with us because we
"reminded her of her depression" - so no depression in the clinic
either. She cut her hair off with scissors, shaved a slit in her eyebrow
and ate a lot. She also met a lot of serious issues through the other
patients. When we collected her she was manic - dropping out of school
and enrolling in TAFE, her new friends at the clinic love her , she was
talking like a machine gun whether we were interested or not, spent all
her birthday money on line, watched Ru Paul's Drag Race relentlessly. 48
hours later came the crash - so down she couldn't eat. What do I do? or
say? She was only doing 3 subjects in Year 11. Next TAFE intake is
February and this is August in lockdown.....she sits on her bed all day
dreaming of her fashion course at TAFE while bonding with drag queens on
line. She only emerges to eat now. It's great that she's more positive
than when she went to the clinic a month ago, so is this it for 6
months? How do we move forward? From what I read here, we have a long
journey ahead. Any advice/ideas would be appreciated.

                 Hi there, I'm not very good at communicating in writing but here goes. I
want to give custody of my 15 yr old to their Dad. I feel as if i've
reached my limit and have no more to give. I had twins at 17, both are
doing well now and parents of my grandkids but during their teen years
both suffered depression and anger issues. Another child at 22, she
suffered serious depression, self harm and suicidal thoughts during her
teens. She ended up in a mental health facility multiple times. Went off
the rails with drugs as well. We had an episode where she was delusional
on drugs. Very scary. But she is doing well now and living with her
boyfriend, working, studying. Now i have a 14 year old still at home.
Multiple seriouse food allergies. Dad and I seperated when they were 3.
We have been dealing with anxiety, depression, self harm and suicidal
ideation. We got them help though Drs and the government youth mental
health service. They have been on medication for almost a year. They
have recently said they identify as a boy (born a girl). This has come
completly out of the blue for me. I don't judge people for anything but
knowing the work that will need to go into this mentally is too much for
me. I did explain this to my child and they seemed ok and said they
would talk to their Head Space pyscologist about it for support. It has
now come to light that they have started self harming again, that they
hear voices telling them to hurt themselves or others. This was found
out by their Dad. He is currently looking into getting them into a
pyschiatrist. My biggest issue at the moment is that I don't think I can
cope with this anymore. I'm thinking that maybe they should live with
their Dad and just have normal visitation with me. I honestly don't
think I can offer the support that they need at this time. This hurts me
alot but I don't know what else to do. I am mentally worn out from all
my childrens mental health issues. I feel like for the last 15 years
I've been dealing with it everyday, one child after another with each
one a bit worse then the last. I don't mean it to sound bad but it has
happened that way, each child has been worse mentally then the last. The
14 year old's dad and I have an okay relationship, not close but no
animosity and able to communicate. But he does live half an hour away
which would make getting to school hard. They would also not want to
live with their Dad as he is more strict then me.

                 Hi everyone One of the other Community Champions thought it would be
good if I shared some information I had on the Autism Spectrum. I’ve dug
a little deeper than my original piece of information as I think it’s an
important topic these days. I'd love to see add what you know about
empowering people with autism. Please feel free to post your
experiences. Throughout my life I’ve worked, socialised and been friends
with people on the Autism Spectrum. I know how life can be difficult for
them and those who support them. Here is some of what I’ve learnt over
my life: Presume intellect: Because a person is non-verbal or struggles
in communication does not mean they are not intelligent nor have nothing
to say. We must explore and utilise the strengths and passions of the
person. Behavior is communication: We may be making a grave mistake when
we simply seek to shut down or suppress with powerful psychiatric drugs
what we judge to be ‘unwanted’ behaviors. Behaviors, even those one may
deem ‘unwanted’ may be for some the only means to convey their needs or
distress. Self-Advocacy: If we wish to understand autism, we must be
willing to enter their world, not force them to enter our own. We must
be willing to validate self-advocates and seek knowledge about the
autistic mode of being from those who actually live it each day.
Relationship: To help autistic persons forge emotional connections,
navigate through the mainstream, and learn new skills, the key is
relationship. We must be willing to forge a bond with the person, to
truly seek to understand their experience, their world, how they find
meaning, to know them as a fellow human being. Once we forge
relationship, we can create a common healing ground Respect: It is
necessary for respect to exist and this means as well that we do nothing
to force, coerce, or manipulate the person. We regard them as a person
worthy of dignity. Our role is to advocate and support, not seek to
alter the person into something they are not nor need be. While I've
learnt all the above, these words were taken from the 2013 article
Autistic Empowerment in Psychology Today by Dan L Emunds. Kind regards

                 I (22F) have been with my boyfriend (25M) for around 10 months now.
Early into our relationship I noticed after drinking, he would
completely change into a different person - yell at me, swear and
verbally abuse me, become aggressive and punch things (never me) and
would hear things and talk to himself and constantly repeat himself. It
later turned out that he was in psychosis set off by certain types of
alcohol. The first time dealing with this was very hard and confronting.
However, I tried to be patient and understand as he is obviously
mentally unwell. This is also a reason he has been in trouble with the
law so many times - he will go into psychosis and cannot be stopped
easily. He doesn't remember anything the next day and is always feels
horrible and is very down for a few days afterwards. As time went on, he
went into psychosis quite a bit and in front of my friends, who were
very worried and didn't want me around him anymore. He decided to quit
drinking for about 4 months and his psychosis stopped and he went to see
a mental health professional. He slowly started introducing small
amounts of alcohol back in but only beer, not hard liquor. Until he got
too confident and drank more and more. Last week, he went into psychosis
again, in public, and verbally abused me in front of everyone again. It
was embarrassing and so disappointing it happened again. This is the
sixth time its happened in 10 months... I love him so much and he is
willing to address his past traumas that have caused this and stop
drinking completely again. However, it is really starting to affect my
mental health - the verbal abuse I take when he is in this state is
really distressing and he doesn't even remember. He thinks I should
break up with him because he doesn't think I deserve this, which I
don't, but I understand mental illnesses and I know he cannot help it
sometimes. But, when do I draw the line? Do I risk putting up with this
for my whole life? I'm not as happy as I once was... I fear if no real
change is made, I am just wasting my time trying to make him better.
What's to say he won't drink at our wedding, for example, and he goes
into psychosis in front of all my family? I'm not sure what to do.

that he needs to see a physiatrist but he doesn't think that he has a
problem. We listen to him without arguing because that would cause him
to become loud and verbally abusive. It's difficult for us to live a
normal life. We go out as much as possible for a break. We love him and
feel powerless to help him.

                 Like many adults, adolescents have their fair share of resistance in
accepting that they may have a "mental illness ". I think it's
especially difficult for adolescents because it's a time when they so
desperately want to fit in and just be normal. So anything that
identifies them as "abnormal" will be difficult to accommodate. That
doesn't mean we don't try and get them help .. so how do we get them
there? Firstly, I would suggest to try to find something that is
bothering them ( as opposed to something that is bothering the parent) .
For example, the child might be not attending school and the parents are
beside themselves about it - but the main issue for the adolescent is
that they find it hard to get to sleep at night. So suggesting a visit
to the GP to work out a way to sleep better at night may be more
fruitful ( even if it's not the main issue in the parents eyes).
Secondly, I would use language that isn't going to stress the young
person out and induce resistance. Terms like "mental illness" or even
"depression" can send them running. But words like "not feeling
yourself" or "feeling stressed" or "feeling down " may be less
confronting, initially anyway . Thirdly, be super reassuring. Keep
telling the young person that you are there for them , that you are
confident that they will get through this, that things will be ok , that
you are there to help them. Part of them will groan but part will be
really relieved . And lastly .. LISTEN . There is a time to not speak
and not do advice but just listen . To really just try and understand
what the young person is going through . If they think that you have put
the time and tolerance in to listening to them without judging or
telling what to do but simply asking more questions, they are MORE
likely to then take advice from you at a later point ( like your advice
about going to the GP for example) . I also think that it is imperative
to book a double appointment with the GP so the young person isn't
rushed and it's ok to also give the GP a call beforehand and give them a
heads up that your loved one is coming in and you have these concerns
... that gives the GP the best opportunity to engage the person. I hope
these few tips might help in this tough situation. What tips do you have
to share? [Mod note: see also beyondblue's Have The Conversation

developed anxiety around eating food thinking that he will choke. He is
now only having liquid food and is really stressed out. He went through
something similar 3 years ago when some popcorn got stuck in his throat.
It cleared and was not an emergency situation but he got a fear of
eating as a res. We were able to get him into a child psychologist and
it was a long and slow process to get him eating again. I took him to
our GP on Monday who did a referral to see a child psychologist again.
The one he saw 3 years ago no longer works there and I got told the
waiting list was over 6 months. I’ve tried several others and all
waiting times are over 6 months. My son needs help now. What am I
supposed to do? This is extremely stressful. How can I get him the help
he needs?

Its not that he's psychotic or anything atm but he has mentally
processed the lockdown in a far negative way even when trying to help
him talk about it and try to suggest things he can do at home with his
time. His daily life doesnt change much if at all really except for
going out a bit here and there, which he can still do for his essentials

aggressively and is not open to understanding things like most people
would. Thing is he is my one contact apart from my family i lve with and
it makes me feel a bit angry that he acts like this when the messages in
the media are always to reach our to your friends via online and phone
etc. Last few time we had lockdowns I never heard from him as he wasnt
well. I guess im just so tired of being there for him and thinking about
his mental health as opposed to my own. I have GAD and high functioning
social phobia/social avoidance disorder and he is the only friend i have
had for some time. I hate that he chooses to act the most crippling of
ways and is not a friend i can ever rely on but he can always rely on
me, i get hurt by that.

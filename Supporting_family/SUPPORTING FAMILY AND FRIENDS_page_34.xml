                 This list has been compiled from experiences supporting my husband with
depression. There is no one size fits all, so please take what you are
comfortable with based on your circumstances and resources. 1. Reach out
to family and/or friends to feel supported - this also covers support
groups - online or face to face. Don't let stigma stop you from reaching
out. 2. Relationship boundaries - identify what is acceptable and not.
My general platform is that physical abuse is unacceptable as well as
regular demeaning/berating comments. Communicate this openly so everyone
understands. 3. Coping tools - this could be exercise, meditation,
reading a book, meeting friends, etc. They are important for your mental
health. 4. Knowledge is power - research to understand about depression.
The more you know, the better care you can provide. 5. Remember your
partner in the good times - this is their true selves, not the darkness.
6. Listen and show receptivity - without judgement or anger. If
communicate becomes strained, the timeout can provide clarity. Encourage
communication gently and try not to push. 7. Seek counselling - sharing
your feelings can provide an opportunity to off load the heavy stuff and
identify resilience and coping strategies. 8. Work as a team - don't let
mental illness be in the driver's seat. Offer to go to the Dr's and
support them. Understand medication and side effects. Be understanding
that some days are harder than others. 9. Words are powerful - remember
what you say cannot be taken back. 10. Carer Self-esteem and self-worth
- if you compromise these for the sake of supporting your partner, you
are likely to live with resentment towards your partner and the
circumstances you find yourself in. 11. Don't forget the children -
challenging circumstances at home can affect them mentally and
emotionally. Speak about mental illness (COPMI.com.au - has some great
resources) and be a strong foundation toward maintaining normality in
their daily activities. 12. Intimacy - there are many variables here, so
from my experience - keep communication open and make couple time to
connect. When my husband was depressed, daily hugs or holding hands
wherever possible worked for us. Some carers I have spoken with said
their partner would demand intimacy. My personal position is that
intimacy is about love without demands or attachments relating to
expectation. Demands only deplete the goodness in the connection and
sharing a a loving experience. [Moderator's note: this thread is for

                 My partner has a myriad of mental health illness...such as PTSD,
anxiety, depression bi-polar and many others. Sometimes i struggle with
communication as i am black and white, and she is multiple shades of
grey...i try to understand things from her perspective however my
logical mind cant seem to follow where she is going. For example..when
she drinks...its 50/50 how the night will go, sometimes its amazing and
we have a great time...other times it can take her to a dark
place...where she will verbally attack me, accuse me of things that i
have not done and just seem to provoke an argument. When this occurs i
disengage and tell her i'm not speaking with her when she is treating me
like this....if she continues i will leave the house for an hour or
2....sometimes when i come home she has calmed, other times she will
sleep in the spare room...yet the following morning she will apologize
for her behaviour. she admits she has a drinking problem, however if i
do speak about it with her she claims i'm controlling. Recently she has
been harassed online by a person who was in a relationship with a friend
of mine....when their relationship went sour he was accusing her of
cheating on her with me.....from that time, this other person found my
partner on social media...and continually makes contact with her telling
her that i cheated on her, making up complete random
accusations....which then my partner turns on me with...i'm just not
sure how to fight a battle where you cant see the opponent....i'm unsure
why she believes him over me. I have brought this up with her to no
avail. She is an amazing woman and i am just looking for advice on how
to deal with some of the situations that arise....i have a diploma in
drugs alcohol and mental health...yet it seems the toold i learned
during that course are for a practitioner and not a partner....and its
not recommended to try and treat a partner. Anybody have any advice or
suggestions

                 My husband &amp; I have been together 36 years, married for 32. I was 16
when we started dating &amp; knew I met my soul mate. Our life was really
great, we were best friends, never fought &amp; we were so in love. My
husband had a couple of bouts of depression which he recovered from with
counselling &amp; medication. Then in late 2010 he suffered severe anxiety &amp;
melancholic depression which was treatment resistant. Our wonderful
doctor (who specialises in mental health) helped my husband through his
previous bouts of illness sent him to a psychologist &amp; psychiatrist.
After counselling &amp; changes in medication failed to work he was admitted
to hospital for ECT. After 10 rounds we decided to stop as he was
hallucinating which was distressing. He spent 7 weeks in hospital having
the ECT, counselling &amp; medication changes but was still very unwell when
he came home. I went to hospital every day, went to almost all of his
counselling sessions &amp; psychiatrist visits for 5 1/2 years &amp; during this
time I had him on suicide watch twice. My life changed so much &amp; then he
finally started to come back. We took a trip overseas which was amazing
but when we returned things started to change. It was gradual so it took
me until things became really bad that I went to our doctor &amp; explained
everything to her. She advised me to go to the psychiatrist again with
him who diagnosed bipolar. Once again my husband was not the man he used
to be &amp; I struggled to come to terms with another mental illness, more
medical visits &amp; more changes in medication. It's now been about 9
months &amp; although he has improved a lot, things between us have changed.
I still care for him but my feelings aren't the same &amp; I don't love him
anymore. Our marriage has deteriorated so much that it's close to being
over. I never in my wildest dreams ever thought this would happen to us.
We were an almost perfect couple. Last Friday I went &amp; had a good talk
to our doctor &amp; she has strongly suggested we have some relationship
counselling which my husband &amp; I have both decided to do. I feel so bad
though because it's his illness that has changed him &amp; therefor causing
the issues so it's not his fault. But I have been through so much, I am
extremely unhappy &amp; I'm scared about the major change that could happen
in my life if we don't get our marriage back on track. I'm feeling very
confused &amp; no one I can talk to really understands my situation. Just
wondering if anyone has been through something similar &amp; what the
outcome was?

was being badly bullied at school. My husband and i "found" and read her
diary and it talked of self harm and suicidal thoughts. We talked t her
over a few weeks about these things and counselling (without revealing
that we knew about her diary). Told her if she every wanted to talk to
someone outside of us she could go to a counsellor. She decided she did
want to see someone. We took her and she has been seeing a counsellor
for a few months now. We also changed her schools. We thought she was
doing better, she seemed happier, made new friends and was coming out of
her shell more. The counsellor has even pushed her sessions back leaving
a bigger gap between them. Last night hubby "found" another notebook
with entries from this week.... talking again about suicidal thoughts
and completing actual acts of self harm. I am not sure what to do. Do we
confront her, speak with the counsellor, take the doors off....i do not
know where to go from here

she suffered at the hands of a family member as a child. After revealing
this her mental health has dramatically deteriorated. She has become an
addict. She is addicted to anything and everything that stops her from
being remotely ‘sober’ through this process she has abused all kinds of
drugs, including most recently, ice. she has abstained from the ice for
a few months now and has instead replaced this with alcohol, drinking
everyday. Sometimes it’s just 2-3 drinks to take the edge off and at
other times it’s benders mixed with cocaine. recently she has confided
more details about her abuse and how she is struggling to me. this has
been horrific for me to hear. she has also told me that she has been
thinking seriously about suicide. She told me that she has even been
planning to access people who she knows have weapons at their houses. I
am so worried for her. I have spoken with her parents at length. they
have gotten her into counciling but she refuses to speak or attend after
the first session. she recently lost her job and is now working casually
on a farm. she has no money to pay any of her debts (which have
accumulated over the years from impulse spending) and it’s looking like
her car will be repossessed.She spends the little money she has on
alcohol. I don’t know how to help her. I feel so helpless and my heart
is breaking. This is not who she is. I am mourning the person she was
and I am so worried that we have already lost her. what should I do?

                 My gf and I have been together for almost 3 years now. During that time
she develped pretty severe anxiety symptoms due to overworking herself.
Now she struggles with managing it, and they come quite often with
symptoms like hyperventilating, shaking, unattention, headaches,
irritability, etc. I love her very much and want to support her the best
I can but its difficult facing the verbal abuse that comes with the
anxiety attacks and just brushing it away. She always feels very guilty
afterwards so I know she dosent mean it and it's her anxiety causing her
to act irrationally. I also understand that it's not her saying these
things but it still hurts and I just have to keep silent and take it. My
way of coping is to have some space alone to recharge. We currently live
in separate places so that is when I am back at my place. However, I get
the feeling that she has become too dependant on using me as an
emotional punching bag and whenever we go back to each others places,
she gets very very upset and blames me for making her anxious. Just
recently we had spend two days together and I told her i needed space
and I would see her tomorrow and she blew up at me and and started
crying and said dont even bother coming over. I really want to help and
support her but I also need space or I risk damaging my own mental
health. We have tried speaking about boundaries before but my need for
space always makes her upset and she says she dosent need space and
wants to see me all the time. Basically she dosent accept my need for
space and it feels suffocating. But I always feel guilty for asking for
space because I feel like I am asking for a bad thing and she always
gets upset. I don't know how to make her understand that I need space
sometimes but that does not mean I care any less about her. I also want
to let her know that although she yells and snaps at me when shes
anxious and I understand that it's not really her talking, it still
affects me and I want her to be more mindful (if she can) I'm struggling
to do it though because I am scared that she will get upset but I still
really need to talk to her. I've spoken to her about therapy but she is
unwilling to get professional help. Any advice is appreciated

deal with for many years now, we have sort the help of therapists and
councilors before but we are always left feeling like nothing has
changed. My daughter is failing school and is not interested in study at
all, she says she does not understand and does not want to make the
effort to try because she knows she will fail. I have to do something
soon to stop this way of thinking otherwise she will end up with no
future possibilities. She has often said she wants to be medicated
saying she has ADHD but none of the professionals we have been to want
to even look at that, they spend months just talking and she gets out of
the sessions and just says its a waste of time. We had these referrals
from her GP a few times. But I need to do more for my Daughter. Any
advice would help.... how can I make this process of helping her happen
faster?

                 My 39 year old son, has had major drug problems all his life. Early on
it was cannabis and alcohol. . For 10 years it has been mainly alcohol
but for a brief stint with methamphetamine. As soon as he has any money,
he buys alcohol and wipes himself out. He has admitted to numerous
psychiatric hospitals, paid for psychiatrists and psychologists. We have
rented houses in our name for him so he's got somewhere to stay . He
fails to pay rent and wrecks the houses. About 3 years ago he came home
for six months. After he had been at home for 6 months I found out he
was secretly taking my wife's credit card and stealing cash from ATMs.
..1000s of dollars When confronted with this, ( I was away at the time
so I rang him) he then drank all the alcohol in my house including all
the wine that have been given to me as a present to put in the cellar.
He has had a partner for the last 2 years, and she has gone through a
similar hell with him. Tired of his drinking and abusive behaviour she
asked him to leave and he is now on the streets. Mind you he is in a car
that I bought for him last year and he is sleeping in that. He was
supposed to pay me for the car but never did. The police rang me the
other night saying someone had seen him and was concerned for his
welfare so he was taken to the emergency department of a public
hospital. He was completely intoxicated.. there were 4 of 5 casks of
wine in his car. I was concerned the car I had given him plus the $700
worth of carpentry tools I bought two weeks ago which were in the car
could all get stolen. I bought the tools because he just started a new
job and had worked for months prior to this . So while he is in the
psychiatric unit I got up at 4:30 a.m., retrieved his car and safely
stored the tools. I washed all his stinking clothes and cleaned the food
and wine casks out of the car . I have told him he cannot come home,
that he must find a room to rent or go somewhere else. 3 years ago when
my son was staying at my house, my wife's jewellery worth about $15,000
was stolen. We suspected it was a girl my son knew. Today I found out
from his current partner that it was in fact my son who stole the
jewellery and sold it to bikies. I'm going to be harsh with him. He's an
adult. No more bailing out. My wife will find this hard but agrees.

                 Hi all, I am a single parent with a son who completed year 12 in 2019.
Since then he has barely left the house. He has caught up with his
school friends only few times. He keeps to himself in his room and
watches Youtube all day/night. He only comes out for meals or to help
with chores. He doesn't work/study and when I try to talk to him, he
shuts down the conversation. I've asked him several times if he was
feeling depressed or suicidal and he's always answered with a strong no.
My son and I lived with my parents. My dad suffers from a chronic
illness, and my mum hasnt been well either. I tried caring for my
parents whilst raising my son and working fulltime. But I'm afraid I may
have given my parents more attention than my own son and admit this may
have caused/contributed to my son's current state. During school my son
had friends and was active in sport. He struggled in school
academically. Every teacher spoke of how respectful/polite he was, but
found him quiet in class, he would never ask for help. I tried to assist
with homework and assessments but he'd quickly shut me down, as I would
in his words "stress him out". During high school, he often complained
of stomach pains and would either arrive to school late or where I was
concerned, I'd keep him home for the day. I always thought he was just
sensitive to dairy (How stupid I was). Fast forward to today, our
conversations don't last longer than a few minutes. He refuses to talk
about work, study or future, he gets angry with me when I try to talk to
him - he says he cant talk to me because I stress him out too much.
Until now I believed I was dealing with a teen who was "maybe" lazy but
definitely lacking in confidence. But then we had a conversation a few
months back that finally opened my eyes. While in the car, I asked him
if he had stomach issues like he did in school. He said no and I asked
why that would be, he said "well I was always anxious about school". I
asked him if he thinks he may have been and still suffering from anxiety
and he said yes. Since then, he agreed for me to email him info from
beyond blue, but no to seeing a GP, psychologist etc. I'm finding that
he is increasingly frustrated with me and/or my approach or just my
general way of talking! Anyone been in this situation? Where should I
start? Maybe I start with me first i.e. how to communicate better? I've
messed up terribly by not recognising the "signs" but am focused on
helping him as he deserves a great life... Thanx

                 My husband thinks he has OCD but is yet to seek a formal diagnosis and
I'm worried he never will. Before we started dating he told me about his
issues (won't eat food other people have cooked and stops having sex a
few months into a relationship). He was going to get help before we
started dating but instead, after waiting 6 months we decided to start
dating and deal with the issues as we go. We're now 11.5 year on,
married with a toddler. About 5 years ago he saw a GP about anxiety at
work but didn't discuss the other issues. He was prescribed anxiety
medication but stopped taking it after a week because he didn't like the
way they made him feel. About a month ago he agreed to go back to the
GP, discuss all his issues including his aversion to sex, talk about his
suspicion that he has OCD and ask for a referral. He went but needs to
get a blood test and decide what specialist he wants a referral to and
he hasn't done any of that. I'm worried he doesn't have enough to
motivate him to get help. He doesn't exhibit compulsive behaviours
because he just avoids situations that trigger the obsessive thoughts.
He has gotten so used to this I don't think he cares about not being
able to share food with friends and he is used to the lack of sex, it
hasn't affected his work, he has a very good job that he thinks his OCD
helps with and has lots of friends who don't know what's going on
because he is very good at hiding it. It does affect me though, I hate
lying to our friends and family and avoiding eating with them and the
lack of intimacy in our relationship is impacting my mental health and
making me question if what there is in our relationship is enough. Even
if he does seek help I'm worried he won't improve. He saw a therapist
many years ago and had a bad experience, we have seen a relationship
counsellor and that went well but mostly because she had a very similar
way of thinking to him and I can't see how that would work with OCD. He
thinks his anxiety about eating food others cook is justified and while
he says he wants to want to have sex its been 2 years sincewe lasthad
sex and beforethat it was only every 3 months so that isn't a big
motivator. I just don't think he sees his thoughts as being wrong or
intrusive and is only mildly inconvenienced by avoiding triggers. How
can I help him/is there any point when he says he wants to get better
but doesn't follow through.

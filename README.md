The research focuses on how mental health can be understood through analyzing peopleâ€™s posts on social media platforms. Many people openly share personal struggles on social media, so this study aimed to identify clues about mental health from these posts.
We develop a dataset, which is a collection of posts from BeyondBlue, Australia's most well-known and trusted mental health organization, labeled with four different categories related to well-being.
The dataset is publicly available for use at: - [Mental Health data for Wellness Dimensions analysis](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hebashakeel/Bert-classification-wellness)
